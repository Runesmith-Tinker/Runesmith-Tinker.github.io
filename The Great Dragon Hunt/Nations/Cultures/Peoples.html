			<h1 header style="font-family: 'Almendra'"> The Peoples of Fluia </h1>
			<p style="font-size:1.25em;">
				The Great Dragon Hunt was written as a setting for a Pathfinder 2e campain. As such, all races below are at least somewhat connected to their PF2e counter part, and will have a link to their Archives of Nethys counterpart. The full list can be found <a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Ancestries.aspx">here</a>
				</br>
				Potentially of more importance, what is below are simply the most common beliefs and views about each race of people. None of them are truely without exception, especially after hundreds of years for races and cultures to intermingle and interact.
			</p>
			<h2 welcome> The Common Races </h2>
				<p>
					<b>
						The peoples known to be among the "common races" are those you may expect to see every day, filling out the crowds you see at the markets or fellow patrons at taverns and inns. Having spread far and wide all across Fluia, most nations are controlled and lead by people of one or mutliple of these races. They are also seen as being the primary descendants of the four ancient tribes that sruvived the Schism.

						<h3>
							Dwarves
						</h3>
						<p>
							<b>
								Stout and sturdy folk, known for their love of the mountains and claim to the depth of the world. On a gneral basis dwarves are often seen as a seclusive race, opting to live only with their own people rather than around others. In fact, many Dunirr settlements actively prohibit entry without a dwarf to watch over those being let in or will simply deny non dwarves entry all together.
								</br>
								Most dwarves stand at around four to almost five feet tall, with most men having pride in their long beards, and women in thick lussious braided hair. Being people "of the land", many of them can often be seen to wear many different kinds of jewelery in their hair. As while it might be denies and rejected by some dwarves, many have an innate talent for earthen magics. Though while beards and hair may be things of personal pride and gender affirmation among their ilk, something universal to their people is that strength is what is seen as truly attractive. Typically this is most often in the form of physical strength, with many dwarves only being willing to wear jewelry they hand crafted, this is not always the case.
								</br>
								ver time, with the seperation of the Zundizar from the Dunirr, a respect for mental strength has grown as well. Thus to many dwarves to have one without the other is foolish, regardless of who you are. So next time you find yourself locked in an arm restle with a dwarf who seems to refuse to either beat you or let you win, know that it is no longer your bron that they're testing.

						<h3>
							Elves
						</h3>
						<p>
							<b>
								"treefolk", "windfolk", or even "moonfolk", the elves are often likened to aspects of nature due to a mix of their inherent talent for natural magic, but also for their seeming "natural" elegnace. Some choose to embrace this with living lives structured around returning to the lands that which they take. Others view this simply as being the way of the past, seeking instead to learn the depth of their talents. As such, most elven structured are built with magic, or sometimes more accurately grown with it.
								</br>
								Elves tend to be on the taller side of humanoid races, but also among the most varied. On average an elf might be around six feet tall for either male or female, but have known to be as tall as seven and a half feet, or as short as almost four and a half feet. Regardless of height though, elves tend to put a heavy weight on the notion of creativity, due to the notion that magic is only limitted by the mind. If one can truely envision it, then one can make it happen. So with having centuries long lives, potentially upwards of almost a millenia, many take their time with showing openness and compassion to others. As despite the common place belief of elves being an overly prideful and potentially "snooty" people, it would be hard to get farther from the truth.
								</br>
								While there of course will be some, especially among notably awful individuals of history, elves tend to take on a much more parental view towards other races. Some elves may reach to living upwards of seven hundred or more years, if they devote themselves in whole to their magic, most only live to maybe five hundred at most. Thus in that time, still far outliving most, many elves take a wider view with seeing the progress most races make in a small fraction of their own life times. So many take on a view point of seeing themselves as responsible for stearing the paths others take in life. This in itself is a large part of why despite elves being seen as almost uncommon or rare, their culture and people can be found almost anywhere.

			<h2 welcome> The Uncommon Races </h2>
			<p body>
				<b>
					Those that fall among the "uncommon" or "exotic" races are also often known as belonging to the "remnant" races. As when the Schism happened, there were many who survived that did not belong to the four main tribes, but still lived in areas protected by them or were sheltered by them. Thus they now live on as remnants of the vastly more diverse world that Fluia once was before the schism. So while the statement of the below being only the most common view points, these peoples are often either far more diverse, or tend to choose to simply integrate with those of a common race that they live close to.
