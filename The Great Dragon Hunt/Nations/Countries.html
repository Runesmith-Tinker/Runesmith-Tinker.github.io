			<h2>
				<span style="font-size: 3em;">Nations</span>
			</h2>
			<p>
				Fluia is a small world, with only a hand full of nations that have managed to stabalize in the current age. However, despite the name of the current era, the is still plenty of conflict that exist, and borders that are frequently argued over. The map below is what is currently most widely accepted by the common folk as being the divides between each nation. Further below is then an oversight on each of the countries. If you wish to read deeper specific information on them, then clicking on the name will take you to their specific page.

			<h3>
				<a href="./Else.html" style="color: black;">Else</a>
			</h3>
			<p>
				The Free Cities are a wide and varied group of city states that all function together as one major nation. In terms of day to day, each territory within the country could be seen as almost its own distinct region, having unique culture and traditions of its own. However, when on the grand scale of meeting at the global table with other nations, they come together as one voice. Due to the freedoms given by how different each city state can be, Else sees almost as much diversity in ancestries as Xendros. The name of the nation even is held in legend to have come from a group of individuals of many peoples, including many elves, standing up to the elven kingdom of old demanding, "give us our freedoms and rights as living people, or else."

			<h3>
				<a href="./Hauland.html" style="color: black;">Hauland</a>
			</h3>
			<p>
				Quaint narrow roads, with houses packed into tight spaces, Hauland can feel to many outsiders as cramped and unwelcoming. Those living in the nation take a pride in everything the things they do, deriving pleasure purely from seeing their works function as intended. This leads many to likening their compact cities to bee hives of ant hills, buzzing with activity. Yet while the closed in nature of their settlements might seem like they're trying to shut out the rest of the world, this is often the opposite of the truth. Instead the people of Hauland look to not upset and disturb nature with their creations, and find joy in being able to calmly experience the natural landscapes uninvaded by man, and take inspiration from what there is out there.

			<h3>
				<a href="./Lithfyre.html" style="color: black;">Lithfyre</a>
			</h3>
			<p>
				Living in a near eternal winter, the people of Lithfyre opt to revere both the snow and the hearth. The blanket of white that covers their homes and roads is often dotted with snow men, and broken by the sights of the citizens taking their time to enjoy one another's company. So if one were to find themself visitting, it should not be taken harshly if their back might be greeted by a playfully thrown snow ball. Once inside though, the liveliness far from vanishes, as every home is warmed and their owners often willing to entertain guests within the front hearth room. As the sun falls, and the cold becomes too much to comfortably bare outside, then the fires are fed extra wood and both warm drinks and food are broken out to end off the day.
