			Below is each of the nations that have grown insto existence across the Continents of Fluia. On this shattered fragment of a long dead world, there were only four tribes in the beginning that survived The Schism. While, there were some survivors that were not of the four clans, all modern ideologies and peoples descend from those mighty tribes.

			Hoarding mountains and open vistas to the south west were the <span style="color: crimson">dragons</span>. 
			</br>
