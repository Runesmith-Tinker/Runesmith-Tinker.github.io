			<h2 welcome> Welcome to the world of Fluia. </h2>
			<p body>
				<b>A bright a resplendent landscape upon a small world that has bee left stripped from the realm it once was part of ages ago. Ever since The Schism nearly a thousand years ago, the world has Been left pulling itself back together by tooth and claw. Tales of grand empires pass by word of mouth from parent to child, with only the ruins of old to make them more than simple myths. From those ruins and rubble though, a few nations have found their way into lasting stability out of the chaos that lasted for centuries after the end of the old world.
				</br></br>
				While for the moment a temperamental peace exists between nations on each of the countries, it comes more from a mutual lingering threat brought with the schism. Massive hulking beasts of old that once ruled one of the continents, now left simply to act as tormentors of those alive today. Legendary Dragons. Creatures that used to be revered as if they were gods, with an empire that stretched the Western continent. Even with the fall of their empire though, a lingering handful still haunt the world. Some are more kindly than others, but all are looked upon with a fearful gaze by the rulers of each nation.</b>

			<h2 The Hunt> The Hunting Season Begins! </h2>

				<b>In the past, fear of these ancient beasts drove each nation to simply cower from them, submit to whatever demands or rituals would appease them, and pray that they would not simply lay waste to their homes. Of recent however, with many countries finding themselves with more firm footing, a fire has been lit. Adventurers rome the lands, helping slay beasts that town guards can't handle, but are too small for entire armies to be turned towards. The understanding of magic has grown enough for universities to be founded teaching about the arcane and occult, rather than it simply being past from master to apprentice. Dungeons have been more actively excavated with the artifacts left from before the Schism offering new light into the powerful enchantments of old. Many countries have even begun toying with the idea of proper adventurer's guilds, as opposed to those that claim to be adventurers simply being vagabonds taking bounties left in taverns. In whole, an a golden age feels close to being right around the corner!
				</br></br>
				As such, one bold nation has taken a daring step forth, that other nations have tentatively thought to follow, but for now simply watch to see what is to come. The Grand Duchy of Sol Announced at the beginning of the new year that any adventurers who presents the head of a legendary dragon to Duke Virantyth Sol would be granted a kings ransom or a wish of their choice. For many this sounded like a challenge well worth losing their lives to, but other saw it as bringing nothing but danger. Thus while the hunt for Legendary dragons remains, many places have outlawed the practice of hunting any other dragons out of fear of their retribution. Yet despite this, the trade of dragon parts in the market of monster parts has drastically grown, with showing quite the profit for those able to get away with it.
				</br></br>
				While none have yet to lay claim to a single legendary dragon, the active study of the creatures has still been a point of interest for many adventurers. In total, there are known to be twenty-six dragons across the world to be given the label of <span	style="color: crimson">"legendary."</span> </b>
