					"Ah, the free cities. Their ivory spires of the capitol and bright clothes make the journey to see them worth it. While there I'd recommend giving the fish a try, as they have some of the freshest around. Honestly, if it weren't for this simply being the start of my journey, and the white buildings hurting my eyes, I'd potentially have considered spending longer. The people are lovely, the sights a delight, and the libraries... I could lose days exploring them."

			<h4>
				Demographic
			</h4>
			<p>
				The most common peoples to see on the streets of any of the free cities are of elven descent, even if not of full elven blood. Beyond those with aiuvarin blood, humans tend to be the next most common sight, but only by a small margin within the colourful crowds. The common races alongside the uncommon all mix and blend within the country, though not without some impact based on which city one finds themself in. As the further north one travels, the more thoroughly mixed the diversity becomes, while further south lends to a more elven dominated presence.
			</p>
			<h4>
				Languages
			</h4>
			<p>
				Elven is the most commonly used language among the natives of Else, but the common trade tongue is widely welcomed by all. However, among any language spoken by the people of Else, their dialects are often heavily influenced by the eclectic joining of just about every other common ancestries native tongue.
			</p>
			<h4>
				Economy
			</h4>
			<p>
				Else's economy is build upon each different city's specialization, and open trade between the different cities. Some level of regulation is handled by the counsel that oversees the nation, but for the most part business are left to their own. 
			</p>
			<h4>
				Government
			</h4>
			<p>
				The Free Cities are each individually ruled over by a single individual that was either voted in, or takes a role almost somewhat like a noble. These individuals are given the title of being the Free City Governors, with each city having varied notions on how they come to be. Similarly, each city also has differing lines of succession behind their governor, be it through election after they pass away, handing the position over to an heir, or having a noble-like class of individuals trained to act as leaders who are fit to take over.
				</br>
				Above the Free City Governors is the Entrothic Council, who are a group of individuals voted into place by the different governors. Usually there are six members on the counsel, but there has been as little as three when the country was founded, and as many as twelve for a single decade. Whenever a member of the counsel dies, steps down, or is voted out by the governors, a special vote is held to decide if a new counselor should be appointed. If the vote is in favour, then five years are given for govenors to either step forwards as candidates, or put forth a candidate other than themself. At the end of those five years, a series of three votes are held over one year to decide on a final candidate. Outside of this process, there have been times when governors have come forward with a candidate without there having been a vote prior, thus enacting a shorter cycle of votes to decide on if they want a new counselor or not.
			</p>
			<h4>
				History
			</h4>
			<p>
				Shortly after the point in time when the Wild Era is seen as having given way to the Peaceful Era, a group of nobles wishing to break from the old ways confronted the leader of the former elven kingdom. The ruler at the time refused to listen to a word of what was to be said, and the threat of open revolt began to fester and strew. However, the second eldest prince of the royal family met with the nobles in private behind the back of his family. They came to an agreement of the lands being divided, with the coalition of nobles being given the lands to the East, all but cutting them off from trade with the western continent. On top of this though, it came with the condition that if they could not show within 10 years that they could form a properly governed nation that did not rely on the old ways, then the lands would be reclaimed.
            	</br>
            	</br>
            	Despite this seeming to give the newly born nation the short end of the stick, they accepted. For the first half decade of the nation's founding years, it seemed almost like the entire situation would be perilous. The few locations that grew organized only did so under a poorly veiled trembling of the social hierarchy of the old ways. Almost everywhere else within the nation was at best total anarchy, and at worst frequent open revolt against the leaders trying to organize them on claim of blood rights.
            	</br>
            	</br>
            	Eventually a group of brave souls came together, led by a single elven woman that crossed the nation collecting who she could. Visiting each of the cities within the span of three years, they collected individuals that could serve as representatives of their cities. In doing so, they also did what they could to gather the will of each city's peoples, understanding their anger with the prior governance and how to move forward. By the ninth year, the Entrothic Council was formed with its first three members. Over the next year, four more members were added, with all members of the council coming forwards to confront Prince Olon in showing a unified front of the Free Cities that would be more than willing to go to war against his nation if he dared to try and reclaim the lands. Without even giving him the chance to try and act as if they were being allowed to govern by his will, they turned and left, sending the message that the Free Cities of Else were not to be seen as a vassal of Olon.
			</p>
			<h4>
				Religion
			</h4>
			<p>
				As varied as the cities are, so too are the views of its people on the gods and even on more localized spirits. Each city state has at least one temple to the six in their main center. However, many of the city states also have local minor deities that they pay homage to. In whole, beyond acknowledging the six in one form or another, there is no truly unified religious belief among the Free Cities of Else.

			<b>Erantious Maritide</b>
			</br>
			The Sun Chancellor
        	</br>
        	A young human man with light brown hair with ashen endings, light skin, bright blue eyes, and an odd boyish charm to his face. He grew up in poverty, and is known to have spent his early years struggling to find any work other than criminal work. As such, he actively and openly admittedly to this being how he lived when making a plea to one of the governors to put him forwards as potential council member. It was a daring act that could have simply landed him in a dungeon for the rest of his life, given the crimes he admitted to. However, seeing that the plea was made not to escape the risk of shackles, but in a hope of improving the country so others would not have to suffer the life he had, the governor helped promote him.
        	</br>
        	</br>
        	<b>Calclavun Calclacliuce</b>
        	</br>
        	The Moon Chancellor
        	</br>
        	The oldest of the Chancellors, often addressed simply as "Calc", is a tall and spindly arctic elf with a bald head, features that seem like they've been stretched over his bones, and deep set silvery eyes. Despite his appearance, and how in some portraits these are accentuated to give him an oddly 'evil' appearance, he is seen as almost the doting old grandfather of the council members. He was among the original three, having known Founder Metroiva himself, and was even the one to ask for her portrait to be hung in the halls. With his growing age, having lived through the entire Wild Era, he's recently been looking for a successor to take his place on the council and ensure they continue to honour the vision their founder had.
        	</br>
        	</br>
        	<b>Yv'gonni Meryfoot</b>
        	</br>
        	The Cloud Chancellor
        	</br>
        	Brimming and bouncing with energy, Yv has bright pink eyes and hair that pair with her lighter skin and often colourful outfits, and is a young gnomish woman. She is the most recent appointed member of the council, having been an ambitious governor before. Befitting her council position and label, she has acted to be the voice of change and reform, willing to broach the topic of when things held firmly onto as tradition needed to change. While this has earned the ire of many towards her, it also was what led to her swift ascent into being a council member after taking over as a governour.
        	</br>
        	</br>
        	<b>Jenev Olonausk</b>
        	</br>
        	The Earth Chancellor
        	</br>
        	With light green skin, long pointed ears, serious deep red eyes, and pulled back dark black hair, Jenev's young goblin features make her stand out from the rest of the council. Similarly to how her appearance stands out, so too do her ideas, with being seen as some of the most out of the box thinking of any of the council members. However, she is also the one most often seen as being at risk of being pushed out by governors looking to force a seat to be open for them to either put themselves or a candidate of their choosing onto the council. This comes more than anything due to Jenev openly being of Gnok culture, which tends to leave many unsettled by the idea of her being in a position of power. Yet she has proven time and time again to earn the trust of the common folk, if not the governors.
        	</br>
        	</br>
        	<b>Toredil Von Calvuskin</b>
        	</br>
        	The Tome Chancellor
        	</br>
        	A tall and old a wise catfolk, with greying black fur and a milky eye to contrast his one still good green eye. Serving the second longest after Calclavun, Toredil was a wizard of high repute before being suggested as a potential council member by many governors. For nearly three decades he was suggested by multiple governors, but turned down the position himself, wishing to focus on his studies and feeling that if he were to be a council member, that it deserved his full dedication. Seeing himself as reaching his twilight years, he accepted the nomination and was voted in overwhelmingly. He is seen as often being the mind of reason and wisdom among the council members when no one can make up their mind.
        	</br>
        	</br>
        	<b>Ethelianor Matelhosk</b>
        	</br>
        	The Shield Chancellor
        	</br>
        	Half orcish, and half elvish, Ethelianor stands tall and proud among the council with their slightly effeminate androgynous features. They have long black hair with the left side shaved short, slightly tan skin, short tusks, and piercing amber eyes. Having previously served as a soldier, many feared that they would be the voice of violence among the council, pushing for the country to assert its power whenever conflict seemed likely. Yet instead, they showed a different side, being acutely aware of the pains of combat, and instead cautioning for finding peaceful resolutions. Though when force seemed inevitable, Ethelianor was the first to offer solutions and tactical plans to come out on top with as few losses as possible on any side.

				People of Importance
			</h4>
			<p>
			<b>Metroiva Evendale</b>
			</br>
			Attributed by many as the founder of the Free Cities of Else, Metroiva was a fairly young elf with pale skin, long brown hair, and emerald eyes. She had a wire thin frame, and many accounts noted how she seemed at any moment like she seemed to barely touch the ground as she walked. However, despite her young age, and eager intent to see her homeland recognize its potential, she died passed away within the last year of the counsil forming. A portrait of her hangs in the in the main council meeting chamber in the capitol of Else, often sited as being a reminder of what they fight for.
