				The Countries and Religions of Fluia
			</h1>
			<p>
				<b>
				Below is each of the nations that have grown insto existence across the Continents of Fluia. On this shattered fragment of a long dead world, there were only four tribes in the beginning that survived The Schism. While, there were some survivors that were not of the four clans, all modern ideologies and peoples descend from those mighty tribes. 
				</br>
				</br>
				Claiming the frozen wastes to the north west were the <a href="./Religions/Solkug%20Descent/GiantCulture.html"><span style="color: lightslategray;">giants</span><a>. 
				</br>
				Hoarding mountains and open vistas to the south west were the <a href="./Religions/Rake%20Descent/DragonCulture.html"><span style="color: crimson">dragons</span></a>. 
				</br>
				Cultivating the marshes and woodlands of the south east were the <a href="./Religions/Eldar%20Descent/ElfCulture.html"><span style="color: midnightblue">elves</span></a>. 
				</br>
				Carving out the mountains and depths of the north east were the <a href="./Religions/Zundizar%20Descent/DwarfCulture.html"><span style="color: saddlebrown">dwarves</span></a>.
				</br>
				</br>
				However, those days have long since passed, with each culture spreading and shaping one another across the world. Barely anything of the founding tribes still exist. At least to the prying eyes of the "civilized folk." For the giants live all but in seclution to the far north beyond where it is habitable for most. Dragons having spread themselves wide have either turned to acting like monsters, or chosen to integrate with modern civilization and even taking on more humanoid forms. The Trow live in sparce ever moving groves, feeling shunned by their descendants for sticking to the old ways. The dwarves of the Dunirr have opted mostly to simply secede from the surface, spreading out across the vast cave networks and chasms of the underdark beneath Fluia.
				</br>
				Now today, mostly the descendants of those ancient cultures intermingal above ground. Their nations have spread across almost every corner of the lands, as shown below.
