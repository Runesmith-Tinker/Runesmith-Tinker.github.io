				Selfish, Belligerent, and Stubborn. These are the three words that most commonly come to the minds of any when the Dunirr are brought up. The dwarven people of "the old ways" also do little to nothing to ever disuade people of seeing them as such. Those who hold fast to the views of the first dwarven clans see all the lands of Fluia as being up for grabs if one pushes hard enough. As such, they hold away in their underground fortresses, rejecting any "lessers" from being permitted entry without putting up a fight. They forge their approach to any situation using beliefs wrought from Kylnvar's aspect of the blade, with being willing to level anything or anyone they see as standing in their way. Yet at the same time, it is because of this very stubborn pride, that more and more Dunirr dwarves have been noted leaving their cities and seeking to see what the world actually holds, be it simply to learn, or to conquer.

						All Dunirr are dwarves, but not all dwarves have what it takes to be <i>Dunirr</i>. This is the sentiment held and repeated by those of the "true descendants" of the Dwarven Earthly clan, passed down from parents to children, generation to generation. As a stubborn Dunirr is a proud Dunirr. Not just sticking to their beliefs and plugging their ears, but showing their beliefs trump all others by force. This last part is why Dunirr do not live in true isolation, but instead forge out into the world to show their might to others, proving that they are in fact superior. After all, it is not the belief of their peopel that they should be the <i>only</i> people on the lands of Fluia. Simply that their people should be the ones to stand above all others in ruling over the lands.
