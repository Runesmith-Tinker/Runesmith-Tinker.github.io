   				Having lived as long if not longer than the oldest of dragons, giants have seen the world turn over and and over. As the world spins, and the revolves around the sun, with old becoming new and then old once again, all things have their cycles. This is the nature of all things as viewed by the seemingly unaging eyes of the giants. It is why they choose to remove themselves from interfering with just about all things, knowing that if they were to prevent what is meant to happen from happening, it may irreversably damage the patterns of nature. Thus when one takes, one must give. When one destroys, one must create. Where there is life, there will always then be death. This is not an excuse for simply being idle, but a mindset that should be held when one chooses to act. As those of the Solkug do not simply sit idly when then purposeful destruction of an important cycle is to happen, but neither should they choose to act to prevent the naturally destructive end of a cycle that will give rise to a new iteration.

   		 <p body>
   			 <b>
   				Often seen as a twisting and embittering of the views of the Solkug, many believe that Gnok cultuer is based around the continuing of the cycle of hatred and violence, but to be the one causing it and not recieving it. However, in truth it is a culture grown from those who have never known anything but the painful end of a whip or the sharp end of a blade, yet want only to bring an end to what they see as unnecessary cycles. To the Solkug they are a lost people, blindly stumbling through the dark who must find their own way, even if it means simply repeating the same acts of hatred that they wish to prevent. However, since the beginning of the peaceful era, there have been some signs of impprovement as those of the Gnok have pushed more to try and properly interact with those of other cultures.
