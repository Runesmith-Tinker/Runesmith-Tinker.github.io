			<p body>

					"Ah, the free cities. Their ivory spires of the capitol and bright clothes make the journey to see them worth it. While there I'd recommend giving the fish a try, as they have some of the freshest around. Honestly, if it weren't for this simply being the start of my journey, and the white buildings hurting my eyes, I'd potentially have considered spending longer. The people are lovely, the sights a delight, and the libraries... I could lose days exploring them."

			<h4>
				Demographic
			</h4>
			<p>
				The most common peoples to see on the streets of any of the free cities are of elven descent, even if not of full elven blood. Beyond those with aiuvarin blood, humans tend to be the next most common sight, but only by a small margin within the colourful crowds. The common races alongside the uncommon all mix and blend within the country, though not without some impact based on which city one finds themself in. As the further north one travels, the more thoroughly mixed the diversity becomes, while further south lends to a more elven dominated presence.
			</p>
			<h4>
				Languages
			</h4>
			<p>
				Elven is the most commonly used language among the natives of Else, but the common trade tongue is widely welcomed by all. However, among any language spoken by the people of Else, their dialects are often heavily influenced by the eclectic joining of just about every other common ancestries native tongue.
			</p>
			<h4>
				Economy
			</h4>
			<p>
				Else's economy is build upon each different city's specialization, and open trade between the different cities. Some level of regulation is handled by the counsel that oversees the nation, but for the most part business are left to their own. 
			</p>
			<h4>
				Government
			</h4>
			<p>
				The Free Cities are each individually ruled over by a single individual that was either voted in, or takes a role almost somewhat like a noble. These individuals are given the title of being the Free City Governors, with each city having varied notions on how they come to be. Similarly, each city also has differing lines of succession behind their governor, be it through election after they pass away, handing the position over to an heir, or having a noble-like class of individuals trained to act as leaders who are fit to take over.
				</br>
				Above the Free City Governors is the Entrothic Counsel, who are a group of individuals voted into place by the different governors. Usually there are six members on the counsel, but there has been as little as three when the country was founded, and as many as twelve for a single decade. Whenever a member of the counsel dies, steps down, or is voted out by the governors, a special vote is held to decide if a new counselor should be appointed. If the vote is in favour, then five years are given for govenors to either step forwards as candidates, or put forth a candidate other than themself. At the end of those five years, a series of three votes are held over one year to decide on a final candidate. Outside of this process, there have been times when governors have come forward with a candidate without there having been a vote prior, thus enacting a shorter cycle of votes to decide on if they want a new counselor or not.
