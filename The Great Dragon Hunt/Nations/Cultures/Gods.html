				<b>
					In the lands of Fluia, there are only a handful of true deities. While there do exist spirits, lesser "gods", or demigods of the lands and of different tribes, villages, and even some aspects of the world that are offered homage and prayed to, they do not rise to the level of true godhood. Of the true gods that do exist, having seemingly risen to their grandeur out of the void that is the Dark Era, there are six. However, each of the six is known to express themselves in many different ways, as their own aspects shift across the different natures of what they uphold to reign over different domains. Thus while two cultures may be beholden to the same prime deity, the aspect of that deity they may revere will most likely be different and as such depicted and worshipped vastly differently. So while no one god belongs to a singular people, each god is more frequently depicted with aspects of one ancestry and gender than of any other.
				</b>
			</p>

			<h2 Zenetta> Zenetta </h2>
			<p>
				<b>
					The sun goddess, also known as The Lustful Dragon, is one of the most prominent gods across all of Fluia. Despite her name, she is not actually associated with the domain of passion. Instead her moniker comes from her eternally chasing after the temperamental trickster moon goddess. Yet even through her desire to be with the one that she loves, she still takes the time to watch over the world and give light to those needing it for work. As such, most labourers and day workers will often wear pendants marked with either her Zenith of Setting symbol. It is also not uncommon for adventurers to adorn their armour with symbols of her Rising aspect, with this sometimes causing conflict to it being a common symbol used by nobility of Rake descent. 
					</br>
					</br>
					Zenetta is typically depicted as a tall woman of athletic build with tanned bronze skin with several scars, patches of golden scales, fiery sun-like eyes, a pair of curved draconic horns above her forehead arching back over her head and then up, and wavy flowing dark red or gold hair. In paintings and statues she normally wears tighter fitting clothing that is somewhat minimalist in design, and sometimes with her having large gold dragon wings. She is the goddess of light, hope, and warmth in all aspects. Her pride and eagerness to achieve whatever she sets her mind to is a core aspect of her identity as a god. From the painting of the sky every sunrise, to mark the beginning of a new day, all the way to her restlessly chasing her love into the dark unknown of night. It is her light that guides all into a brighter future and out of the darkness of the past.
					</br>
					</br>
					<u>Prime Domains:</u> <i>Family, Soul, Sun</i> 
				</b>
			</p>
			<h3 Rising> Rising </h3>
			<p>
				<b>
					The mark of Rising Zenetta is usually drawn as a dragon sat atop a mount of gold with its wings out and head held high, or simply as the upper half of a semicircle with three dominant rays pointing, two to the sides and slightly up and one directly up. This aspect rules over the starting fire and burning ambition to achieve a task one has freshly begun and set their mind to. One of the core tenets is refusing to let one's inner fire die before it has seen its peak. Its most common followers are nobles, entrepreneurs, and new adventurers.
					</br>
					<u>Domains:</u> <i>Ambition, Fire</i> 
				</b>
			</p>
			<h3 Zenith> Zenith </h3>
			<p>
				<b>
					The mark of Zenith Zenetta is usually drawn as a dragon in flight with its wings out and a short pointed ray above and below it, or simply as a circle with four dominant rays in the cardinal directions, but with the left and right rays being much longer. This aspect rules over the height of one's creations and the pinnacle of success, watching then over all that happens below to ensure that it may too rise to similar heights. One of the core tenets is to offer aid to those trying just as hard as you, but who are left downtrodden by events and fate outside of their control. Its most common followers are city guard captains, fathers, and advisors.
					</br>
					<u>Domains:</u> <i>Cities, Wyrmkin</i> 
				</b>
			</p>
			<h3 Setting> Setting </h3>
			<p>
				<b>
					The mark of Setting Zenetta is usually drawn as a curled up dragon sleeping atop a pile of gleaming gold, or simply as a full circle with three dominant rays, two to the sides and slightly down and one directly down. This aspect rules over hard work that aims towards improving oneself and what they care about, as well the rewards of tireless labour that deserves a long rest and solid pay for. One of the core tenets is to never accept payment for dishonest work, as honest work will always eventually provide a far better reward. Its most common followers are merchants, labourers, and accountants.
					</br>
					<u>Domains:</u> <i>Wealth, Toil</i> 
				</b>
			</p>
			<h3 Eclipsed> Eclipsed </h3>
			<p>
				<b>
					The mark of Eclipsed Zenetta is usually drawn as the simplified form of Zenith Zenetta, but with the prominants rays shortand, and a darkened inner circle. This aspect rules over the destruction of what is normally expected and the divine beauty that can come when blinding light gives way to soothing darkness that can reveal what once was hidden. One of the core tenets is to never believe what is to be willing to tear away the light that might blind others in order to help them see things from a fresh point of view. Its most common followers are rebels and freedom fighters, vigilantes, and ambassadors.
					</br>
					<u>Domains:</u> <i>Darkness, Destruction</i> 
				</b>
			</p>

			<h2 Orophet> Orophet </h2>
			<p>
				<b>
					The moon goddess, also known as The Sly Elf, is only slightly less commonly followed than her lover across Fluia. Eternally she dances and runs from Zenetta, hiding behind their children to tease the other and stoke the other's flames. Though what is most commonly meant in jest and desire, may sometimes turn more sinister. For this reason, be it from laughter or sadness, it is believed the stars she paints across the sky at night are in fact her own tears. Yet even despite her non-stop game with the sun goddess, she can still be seen at times slinking into the domain of brighter half to ensure that the lustful dragon still knows her sly elf holds her close. Thus it may be common to see her symbols hung from taverns, brothels, and the homes of newly weds of just about any culture. Those that follow her teachings and perform magic though are often looked upon with suspicion, due to the magics associated with her often being far more chaotic and formed through simple desire for their outcome rather than understanding of how it may be reached.
					</br>
					</br>
					Orphette is typically depicted as a dainty and eerily beautiful elven woman with almost paper white skin, silvery hair, and deep sapphire eyes. In paintings and statues she is normally wearing long flowing robes that tend to be reflective, or black and silver. She is the goddess of love, imagination, and the ocean. Just as Zenetta paints the sky gorgeous shades orange and purple at dawn and dusk, Orophet speckles the nights with shimmering stars. It is in her wild creativity that many find their first steps into learning magic before turning to the teachings of Agnosti to avoid falling into chaos. On the other hand, for sailors she is a lifetime compatriot and guide, with the bending of tides being at her will and it being by her tears that navigators find their way across the vast oceans.
					</br>
					</br>
					<u>Prime Domains:</u> <i>Moon, Water</i> 
				</b>
			</p>
			<h3 Waxing> Waxing </h3>
			<p>
				<b>
					The mark of Waxing Orophet is usually drawn as a woman with long hair with her hands held parallel in front of her abdomen with a ball of light between her palms, or simply as a waxing crescent moon. This aspect rules over the start of creating something new and the luck that comes with being a beginner to something one doesn't quite understand but is thus encouraged to learn from early success. One of the core tenets is to always try one's luck when attempting something new, and use that luck to bring something new and great into the world. Its most common followers are bards, gamblers, and thieves.
					</br>
					<u>Domains:</u> <i>Creation, Luck</i> 
				</b>
			</p>
			<h3 Bright> Bright </h3>
			<p>
				<b>
					The mark of Bright Orophet is usually drawn as a dancing woman with long hair in loose silver clothing, or simply as a silvery full moon. This aspect rules over the deception of mimicking another's skills shown by another that one does not possess themself as a form of showing one's passion for the other they are mimicking. One of the core tenets is to put your all into what you care about to show your love for it, even if that means cheating behind the closed curtains to produce the outcome that you desire. Its most common followers are prostitutes, magicians, and actors.
					</br>
					<u>Domains:</u> <i>Passion, Trickery</i> 
				</b>
			</p>
			<h3 Waning> Waning </h3>
			<p>
				<b>
					The mark of Waning Orophet is usually drawn as a tired and resting woman with long hair laying curled on the ground, or simply as a waning crescent moon. This aspect rules over the crossing of thresholds and moving from the known into the unknown, and trying to make sense from that which one cannot fully understand. One of the core tenets is to keep one's inner dreams strong, even when it might feel like nothing matters. Its most common followers are oracles, dream walkers, and Void seekers.
					</br>
					<u>Domains:</u> <i>Dream, Void</i> 
				</b>
			</p>
			<h3 Dark> Dark </h3>
			<p>
				<b>
					The mark of Dark Orophet is usually drawn as a distraught woman with long hair openly crying and looking up, or simply as a dark new moon. This aspect rules over the melancholy and dread of losing what one held dear, and the extent one might go to in order to escape that pain and reclaim what was lost. One of the core tenets is to hold close that which you cherish and never take it for granted, lest your worst nightmares come true and you lose what you care for in the blink of an eye. Its most common followers are necromancers, astronomers, and eldritch researchers.
					</br>
					<u>Domains:</u> <i>Nightmare, Star, Undeath</i> 
				</b>
			</p>

			<h2 Anador&Rodana> Anador & Rodana </h2>
			<p>
				<b>
					The twin nature gods, also known as The Landstriders, is one of the few gods you will almost never find a temple for of any kind, but who has shrines all across the lands. For druids, hunters, adventurers, and just about any known to wander far and wide, depictions of The Landstriders' symbol are often a welcome sight. One of Their core tenets is that no form of life can truly survive entirely on its own, and thus to give to others just as you take from the wilds. Though if seen carved into the side of a cave rather than into the door of a cottage, it may be best to turn back before you find yourself facing nature's wrath. As while the giants that Anador and Ronada are often associated with are known to be peaceful beings, the monstrous races and beasts that have sought shelter beneath them are rarely as welcoming.
					</br>
					</br>
					Anador is typically depicted as a tall well built healthy young human-like man with lightly tanned skin, shoulder length oak brown hair, and emerald green eyes. Rodana is typically depicted as a short and sometimes sickly young human-like woman with ashen skin, waist length dark brown and grey hair, and earthy brown-green eyes. In paintings and statues both are normally wearing earthy or plant based coloured attire, but with Anador normally being dressed for spring or summer while Rodana appears dressed more for fall or winter with a snake resting on her shoulders.They are the god of the natural order, life, death, and travellers. Like two sides of a coin, one simply cannot be without the other, and thus in spite of being often seen as two figures, they are still only one god. It is from their harmony that adventurers and travellers are tought to keep in mind that where Anador leads, Rodana follows, and thus where there is life there will always be death. However, this is not necessarily a bad thing.
					</br>
					</br>
					<u>Prime Domains:</u> <i>Nature, Travel</i> 
				</b>
			</p>
			<h3 Growing> Growing (Anador) </h3>
			<p>
				<b>
					The mark of Landstrider Aanador is usually drawn as either a growing sapling or simply as an ash leaf. This aspect rules over the beginning and flourishing of life, alongside the joy of experiencing all that there is to the world. One of the core tenets is to indulge in all of what life has to offer, but in turn to be sure and return just as much as you take. His most common followers are doctors, adventurers, and outcasts that have been labelled as among the "monster races."
					</br>
					<u>Domains:</u> <i>Healing, Indulgence, Swarm, Wood</i> 
				</b>
			</p>
			<h3 Wilting> Wilting (Rodana) </h3>
			<p>
				<b>
					The mark of Landstrider Rodana is usually drawn as either a skeletal snake devouring its own tail or simply as ring with a much smaller circle breaking it. This aspect rules over the inevitable end of all things and completing of a cycle, thus returning back to the nothingness from whence all things came. One of the core tenets is acknowledging that death is simply another part of life, and as such the dead deserve just as much respect as the living, simply with different needs. Its most common followers are doctors, hermits, undertakers, and caretakers.
					</br>
					<u>Domains:</u> <i>Death, Decay, Earth, Plague, Naga</i> 
				</b>
			</p>

			<h2 Okarine> Okarine </h2>
			<p>
				<b>
					The sky god, also known as The Lightning of the North, is most commonly prayed to by those looking for a change in their life, be it large or small, or for guidance through a change they have little control over. Her temples tend to offer aid to those undergoing some form of transition period in their life and are seeking help in either understanding or support. There are many legends about how while the sun goddess was the leader of the six, it was the sky goddess that encouraged them all. Thus while she is associated with change, she is also frequently depicted alongside Agnosti on the matter of changing into being a truer version of one's self. Though because of this, and some spoken legends of old, she has also come to be seen as a patron goddess of transgender individuals. In many tales as well, it is spoken about how she would always encourage others on the point of bringing out their own greatness by being the most positive version of themselves that they want to be. This was with the exception of when that greatness might lead one to bringing unwarranted harm to others.
					</br>
					</br>
					Okarine is typically depicted as a short energetic woman with a lithe build and small chest, pale skin that has patches of silver-blue scales, bright blue eyes that seem to sparkle, and extremely long pale blue hair that flows behind her. In paintings and statues what she is wearing tends to depend on her aspect, with her wearing almost no clothes or very little transparent attire for clear, more covering attire for cloudy, and armour sparking with electricity for stormy. Depending on the artist, for clear she is also known to be drawn as a trans-fem as a showing of her representation of change. She is known to often spend time with both the sun and moon gods, usually happily offering the sky as a canvas for each to paint across.
					</br>
					</br>
					<u>Prime Domains:</u> <i>Air, Change</i> 
				</b>
			</p>
			<h3 Clear> Clear </h3>
			<p>
				<b>
					The mark of Clear Okarine is usually drawn as Three swirls of air pushing in against each other, or simply as either a light blue celtic trefoil knot or triskelion. This aspect rules over the freedom of knowing what one desires from themself and power that comes with reaching that personal pinnacle state. One of the core tenets is to help others that are not happy with who they are to realize their own personal greatness and how it helps not just them, but others too, and to thus bring it out. Its most common followers are transgender individuals, bards, and anti-slavers.
					</br>
					<u>Domains:</u> <i>Confidence, Freedom, Perfection</i> 
				</b>
			</p>
			<h3 Cloudy> Cloudy </h3>
			<p>
				<b>
					The mark of Cloudy Okarine is usually drawn as a cloud with a small amount of snow below it or simply as a light blue four pointed ice crystal. This aspect rules over shifting unease and chill that may come in a time of transition, where anything may happen, be it good or bad. One of the core tenets is acceptance towards one's own inner shifts and the fact that no matter how perfect one may be in one moment, that may not be what is best soon after. Its most common followers are those experiencing times of great strife, fortune tellers, and spiritual guides.
					</br>
					<u>Domains:</u> <i>Cold, Fate</i> 
				</b>
			</p>
			<h3 Stormy> Stormy </h3>
			<p>
				<b>
					The mark of Stormy Okarine is usually drawn as a dark storm cloud with three lightning bolts coming out from below it or simply as a light blue lightning bolt. This aspect rules over the inner fury held by those trying their hardest to be the best person they can be, only to face the endless criticisms and insults of those with no desire to understand their struggle. One of the core tenets is to be willing to stand in opposition to those who seek nothing but to bring others low rather than raise themselves up. Its most common followers are adventurers, vigilanties, and those seeking to overthrow cruel and unfair rulers.
					</br>
					<u>Domains:</u> <i>Lightning, Abomination</i> 
				</b>
			</p>

			<h2 Agnosti> Agnosti </h2>
			<p>
				<b>
					The god of knowledge and magic, Also known as The Hidden One, is believed to have been the one to usher Fluia out of the dark era with bringing into existence the first written language since The Schism. All across the lands, many hidden temples exist holding what is alleged to be their scriptures, writing a solidified nature of the world into existence. Rather than texts on what was, recording the events of the dark era, Agnosti's texts instead describe what is and what shall be. Thus any time a temple to the Hidden One is found, it commonly becomes a site of great interest to scholars, especially due to how cryptic anything that has been translated has been. However, while these texts have helped shed new light in advancing the study and craft of magic, it is also believed that Agnosti and Orphet were often at odds in how they viewed magic should exist. While the moon goddess felt it should be an artistic practice, performed much like how the gods are believed to use it, the knowledge god felt it should be a strict system with defined rules for what mortals could use to avoid another schism. Thus it has existed somewhere in-between both ever since.
					</br>
					</br>
					Agnosti is one of the only gods that is almost never depicted the same between two artists, with there existing no known details as to how they looked, nor even a hint of their gender. Instead in paintings and statues they are most commonly depicted as a cloaked figure with gloves and a hood pulled to hide their features, a mask covering their visage, or an opened book in front of their face. Alternatively they are shown from behind or facing just enough away from the viewer to make it impossible to discern just about any of their features. The reason for this exists written within their first texts, stating that the truest form of a god should never be known by mortals, and to show anything less would simply be a lie, thus to let whatever image is chosen to represent them instead represent all scholars and collected knowledge. However, it has been recorded that they have been known to speak to some of their followers, always offering guidance with the voice of someone that person holds as a font of knowledge and wisdom.
					</br>
					</br>
					<u>Prime Domains: </u> <i>Knowledge, Glyph, Magic</i> 
				</b>
			</p>
			<h3 Fact> Fact </h3>
			<p>
				<b>
					The mark of Fact Agnosti is usually drawn as a closed scroll with a quill laying across the top of it, though sometimes only one of the two is shown. This aspect rules over that which factually is, be it known or unknown, and the uncovering of truth pulled from embellishment and falsehoods. One of the core tenets is to respect the bounds of that which is simply not for you to know, but always to delve and look for the truth in what has been presented before one. Its most common followers are scholars and academics, wizards, and advisors.
					</br>
					<u>Domains:</u> <i>Introspection, Repose, Truth</i> 
				</b>
			</p>
			<h3 Fiction> Fiction </h3>
			<p>
				<b>
					The mark of Fiction Agnosti is usually drawn as an open book with a dripping fountain pen laying across the pages, though sometimes only one of the two is shown. This aspect rules over the embellishing of that which is, that which is not, and that which those which many may desire to be, and thus write into an alternate existence. One of the core tenets is to never feel limited by the seemingly strict boundaries that exist in the world, and instead to create one's own view of what should be and to give it a place in the world. Its most common followers are novel authors, thaumaturges, wizards and witches.
					</br>
					<u>Domains:</u> <i>Delirium, Secrecy, Time</i> 
				</b>
			</p>

			<h2 Kylnvar> Kylnvar </h2>
			<p>
				<b>
					The god of smithing and war, also known as The Slayer, is believed to have been the first and oldest of the gods with many of his features often being referenced as forms of sudo-swears. Often this form of speech is done with accentuation of how mangled his form is, detailing that a large part of the reason for his wearing a helmet was not just to protect himself but to hide his features. Much like how those that have seen the hell that is war may choose to try and protect others from bearing witness to its atrocities. In fact he is believed to have attained many of his scars in battle acting as a protector for Okarine and Rodana, preferring to allow for harm to come to himself than those he saw as fragile. Though while he might have let himself act as a shield to those two and is the most martially inclined of the six, he is generally seen as a blacksmith first, and warrior second. Many a fabled artifact from the dark era is assumed to have been forged by his hands, including the armour and weapons used by each of the six gods. The only god he never created anything for was Agnosti, with the two instead viewing one another as equal craftsmen in their own right, and instead offering insight on what should be written as well as aiding in the carving of the knowledge god's texts in his lost temples.
					</br>
					</br>
					Kylnvar is typically depicted as a rather large dwarven man with rough scar covered pale skin, either deep shadowed eyes or eyes that burn a blood red, and bearing a long braided fiery red beard adorned with many pieces of jewellery and decorations. In paintings and statues he normally is wearing a blacksmith's apron with a short sleeved tunic with his large arms riddled with scars being shown off, and donning either a full helm covering his head or a metal mask over his face. Additionally, despite his two aspects, unless being drawn or chiselled to specifically represent one of them, he is most commonly seen carrying a smithing hammer rather than a weapon or armour aside from his helm. In some depictions he does not wear his helm or a mask, but still carries it with him, showing his heavily marred and disfigured visage. As it is in his teachings, passed down both by spoken legends and the writings of Agnosti, that he speaks on how war and mortal conflict are both things that can be taken pride in, but also should be despaired over. It is right to feel pride in protecting your home and family whilst laying low your enemies that might threaten them. Yet the loss of life and the chance for peaceful resolution should in turn just as equally be despaired and grieved over in hopes of preventing future conflict.
					</br>
					</br>
					<u>Prime Domains: </u> <i>Metal, Zeal</i> 
				</b>
			</p>
			<h3 Blade> Blade </h3>
			<p>
				<b>
					The mark of Blade Kylnvar is usually drawn as a full helm with a sword and a spear crossed piercing through the helm, or simply as a sword with the blade facing down. This aspect rules over power to bring one's enemies low and in doing so prevent any chance for those enemies to exert their strength over you. "May thy enemy know thy pain and the pain of those thou cherish, and may thou stand watch over all thou hast lost." One of the core tenets is to never waver in the face of opposition, holding firm upholding the virtues and ideals one believes in. Its most common followers are soldiers, gladiators, and rulers.
					</br>
					<u>Domains:</u> <i>Dust, Pain, Tyranny, Vigil</i> 
				</b>
			</p>
			<h3 Bulwark> Bulwark </h3>
			<p>
				<b>
					The mark of Bulwark Kylnvar is usually drawn as a full helm placed in front of a kite shield, or simply as just a kite shield. This aspect rules over the strength to guard against any onslaught brought by one's enemies in order to protect that which one holds dear. "May thy arms never weaken, for if they do, then thou shalt know not but the taste of thy enemies blade, and may thy anguish be thy shield." One of the core tenets is to never lose sight of that which you are protecting, and to burden whatever suffering might come in order to ensure what you protect never feels that pain. Its most common followers are blacksmiths, city guards, and veterans.
					</br>
					<u>Domains:</u> <i>Duty, Might, Protection, Sorrow</i> 
				</b>
			</p>

			<h2 Other> Other Beings </h2>
			<p>
				<b>
					Beyond the scope of the six, as described at the top, there do exist other gods <i><u>like</u></i> beings. In many regions, while worship of the six is held in high regard, they may choose instead to follow a more local minor god or patron that is specific to their village or people. There do also exist minor divine beings like fiends and celestials that will offer their aid more directly than the six in exchange for the person they are helping pledging themself to the being. Then beyond even that are what are known as the outsiders. Beings that do not hold any true position of control over any of the pillars of reality, yet still have a cult following for their god-like power. Most outsiders are seen by the majority of people as corrupting beings born from the chaos of the Schism, seeking only to finish what had been started. So while they may have worshippers, it is often not by the free will of those offering them homage.
