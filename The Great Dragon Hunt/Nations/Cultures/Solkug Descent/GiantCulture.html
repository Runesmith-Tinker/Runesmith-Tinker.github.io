				Having lived as long if not longer than the oldest of dragons, giants have seen the world turn over and and over. As the world spins, and revolves around the sun, the old becoming new and then old once again, all things have their cycles. This is the nature of all things as viewed by the seemingly unaging eyes of the giants. It is why they choose to remove themselves from interfering with just about all things, knowing that if they were to prevent what is meant to happen from happening, it may irreversibly damage the patterns of nature. Thus when one takes, one must give. When one destroys, one must create. Where there is life, there will always then be death. This is not an excuse for simply being idle, but a mindset that should be held when one chooses to act. As those of the Solkug do not simply sit idly when then purposeful destruction of an important cycle is to happen, but neither should they choose to act to prevent the naturally destructive end of a cycle that will give rise to a new iteration.

						The defining of a cycle is a difficult task that often takes many life times to observe. In this essence, patience is a virtue valued above almost all other things by those of the Solkug. Patience to see what will happen, and patience with one's self to accept what is. Thus simply living a natural life with no desire to break from what the threads of fate seem to lay out before one is seen as a positive thing. Because of this, many of the Solkug who are not giants tend to find their way to being druids, tending to the lands and living without desire to overly connect themselves to any one thing. If one does grow attached to something though, then it is advised to take time and observe before trying to steer the path of something one cares about. As sometimes it is best to simply accept the path something is on will lead to its end, than to try and prevent it at risk of an unknown outcome.
						</br>
						</br>
						To many, this ‘outsiders watching inwards’ appearance of those of the Solkug comes off almost like they see themselves on par with the gods. Not in terms of power or dominion, but instead in disconnection. Seeing them as having little care for the world, and choosing simply to follow a nihilistic path of simply standing by to watch as all things burn and crumble. However, this often leads to great surprise when those of the Solkug do finally choose to step in, showing far greater care than one might have anticipated. As while they may stand by and watch from the sidelines when time permits, this is only to ensure that when they act, it can be to great effect and without unforeseen ill repercussions.
						</br>
						</br>
						Having been around during the Dark Era, the depictions of the gods left in ruins of giant settlements before they fully receded into the north are cited by many scholars as the most true depictions of them. This comes for a few reasons, with the first being as started with the giants having been present to witness them. Beyond this, it is believed that any attempt to purposefully alter from the truth could be seen as a form of attempting to affect and direct the future, directly standing in opposition to a core belief of the Solkug. How true these notions are is hard to verify, given the isolated nature of the giants of the Solkug. Even in spite of this, there have been findings of a rare few temples, seemingly built in by the giants in honour of the twin god of life and death. In whole though, these depictions match quite closely to the current commonly held views of how each of the gods look, with some artistic liberties accounted for.

			<h2 The Eldar> The Gnok </h2>
			<p body>
				<b>
				Often seen as a twisting and embittering of the views of the Solkug, many believe that Gnok culture is based around the continuing of the cycle of hatred and violence, but to be the one causing it and not receiving it. However, in truth it is a culture grown from those who have never known anything but the painful end of a whip or the sharp end of a blade, yet want only to bring an end to what they see as unnecessary cycles. To the Solkug they are a lost people, blindly stumbling through the dark who must find their own way, even if it means simply repeating the same acts of hatred that they wish to prevent. However, since the beginning of the peaceful era, there have been some signs of improvement as those of the Gnok have pushed more to try and properly interact with those of other cultures.

						Being the descendants of slaves and the tormented, the culture of the Gnok has long been steeped in hatred and suffering. In separation from the views of the Solkug, they believe not all cycles should be allowed to exist. As those that are disruptive and cause an undo pain should be broken and the tormented given a chance to heal and form a better cycle to grow from. Thus the young of the Gnok are handed the charge of breaking cycles of pain that they come across, be it that of their own, or that of other cultures even. However, a lesson that the eldest among the Gnok have struggled to pass down to younger generations is that it is often the wounded and harmed are the ones most likely to purposefully cause the same pain they have felt to others. Yet often the young ignore such tales on the belief that it is simply the old and enfeebled losing sight of how the rest of the world sees them, and simply rolling over to accept their place beneath the boot of all others.
						</br>
						</br>
						The violent outlook and response to the past aggressions towards their people is often all that outsiders see of the Gnok. Viewing them as little more than crazed beasts, sheltered by the giants, wishing only to burn and kill. Admittedly, this outlook is not wholly unwarranted, as for a long time the escaped enslaved beast races and "monsters'' of the dragon empire did seek little more than revenge and retribution. This view is often not helped by the common graphic depictions of suffering and pain displayed artistically by the Gnok peoples. However, these depictions are commonly misunderstood as showings of aggression and anger, when in their creation they are made as a desire show others the pain that their peoples have felt and wish to see brought to an end not just for themselves, but for all. Their road is one filled with pitfalls for being cornered into being nothing more than the wild animals many see them as, but even in spite of that, most stand with hope and pride in their eyes when claiming to be of the Gnok peoples.
						</br>

						Once long ago, the depictions of the gods as portrayed by Gnok were mostly twisted and cruel depictions of them. Zenetta took the form of a fat and cruel dragon, bringing only fire and death. Orophette of a cruel elf that sought only to trick them into being subservient to other races. Agnosti as an unknowable abomination with many slimy tentacles reaching out to sew lies into their minds and twist the truth. Kylnvar as a tyrannical blood thirsty brute whose sword was a cleaver made to cut down the Gnok like caddle, and his shield adorned by spikes with a dead goblin baby impaled on them. The remaining two gods though, tended to be depicted in a much better light. Anador and Rodana were shown as giants, often wearing at most clouds to cover them, with Anador bringing plagues and disaster to those that threatened the Gnok, while Rodana gave them food and showed them how to live in the wilds. Of all the gods though, Okarine was viewed the most differently from her common interpretations. Stripped of any semblance of draconic origin, she was depicted as a tall goblin with pale blue skin to match her hair and eyes, leading the Gnok from slavery and showing them what it meant to be free. As time has progressed those, the more "evil" depictions of the other gods has lessened, coming closer to being of a nature akin to how the Solkug depict them.
