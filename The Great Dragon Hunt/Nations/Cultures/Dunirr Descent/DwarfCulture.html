				Selfish, Belligerent, and Stubborn. These are the three words that most commonly come to the minds of any when the Dunirr are brought up. The dwarven people of "the old ways" also do little to nothing to ever disuade people of seeing them as such. Those who hold fast to the views of the first dwarven clans see all the lands of Fluia as being up for grabs if one pushes hard enough. As such, they hold away in their underground fortresses, rejecting any "lessers" from being permitted entry without putting up a fight. They forge their approach to any situation using beliefs wrought from Kylnvar's aspect of the blade, with being willing to level anything or anyone they see as standing in their way. Yet at the same time, it is because of this very stubborn pride, that more and more Dunirr dwarves have been noted leaving their cities and seeking to see what the world actually holds, be it simply to learn, or to conquer.

						All Dunirr are dwarves, but not all dwarves have what it takes to be <i><u>Dunirr</u></i>. This is the sentiment held and repeated by those of the "true descendants" of the Dwarven Earthly clan, passed down from parents to children, generation to generation. As a stubborn Dunirr is a proud Dunirr. Not just sticking to their beliefs and plugging their ears, but showing their beliefs trump all others by force. This last part is why Dunirr do not live in true isolation, but instead forge out into the world to show their might to others, proving that they are in fact superior. After all, it is not the belief of their peopel that they should be the <i>only</i> people on the lands of Fluia. Simply that their people should be the ones to stand above all others in ruling over the lands. As such, there are some generally positive values pushed to their people, often on the point of good leadership skills, as a firm hand controlling one's subordinates won't resolve problems originating from the one leading the way.

						Beyond the secretive fortresses of the Dunirr peoples, the dwarves that reside within often look like little more than pigheaded fools with rocks for brains. Their iconography often depicts ravionous dwarven warriors trampling over those of other nations and cultures, leaving nothing but rivers of blood in their wake. Thus more than a handful of tales of the mindless hoard hidden below the Xendros's Divide Mountain range, waiting in their endless winding tunnels for the day to burst fourth and lay waste to the lands. Yet while the Dunirr may take pride in their hardheadedness, they are also far from braindead fools. As even if they might be stuborn and unwilling to view others as ever their betters, those of the Dunirr do listen and learn. From a young age they are taught not to scoff at the views of others, but learn what could give them strength, and to then make it their own. For this reason, while they might often be unpleasant to work with, Dunirr dwarves are actually not all to uncommon to find in positions of power or leadership. Though, this often is with someone else still higher up watching over them.
