			<h1 header style="font-family: 'Almendra'"> The Peoples of Fluia </h1>
			<p style="font-size:1.25em;">
				The Great Dragon Hunt was written as a setting for a Pathfinder 2e campain. As such, all races below are at least somewhat connected to their PF2e counter part, and will have a link to their Archives of Nethys counterpart. The full list can be found <a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Ancestries.aspx">here</a>
				</br>
				Potentially of more importance, what is below are simply the <u><i>most common</i></u> beliefs and views about each race of people across Fluia. None of them are truely without exception, especially after hundreds of years for races and cultures to intermingle and interact.
			</p>
			<h2 welcome> The Common Races </h2>
				<p>
					<b>
						The peoples known to be among the "common races" are those you may expect to see every day, filling out the crowds you see at the markets or fellow patrons at taverns and inns. Having spread far and wide all across Fluia, most nations are controlled and lead by people of one or mutliple of these races. They are also seen as being the primary descendants of the four ancient tribes that sruvived the Schism.

						<h3>
							Dwarves
						</h3>
						<p>
							<b>
								Stout and sturdy folk, known for their love of the mountains and claim to the depth of the world. On a gneral basis dwarves are often seen as a seclusive race, opting to live only with their own people rather than around others. In fact, many Dunirr settlements actively prohibit entry without a dwarf to watch over those being let in or will simply deny non dwarves entry all together.
								</br>
								</br>
								Most dwarves stand at around four to almost five feet tall, with most men having pride in their long beards, and women in thick lussious braided hair. Said hair is generally dark in colour, with either being deep brown, black, or at the brightest as sharp orange. Their skin on the other hand is commonly on the pale side for those living under ground, ranging to being dark grey, while above ground it can take on all the same tones human skin might. Additionally, being people "of the land", many of them can often be seen to wear many different kinds of jewelery in their hair. As while it might be denied and rejected by some dwarves, many have an innate talent for earthen magics.
								</br>
								</br>
								Though while beards and hair may be things of personal pride and gender affirmation among their ilk, something universal to their people is that strength is what is seen as truly attractive. Typically this is most often in the form of physical strength, with many dwarves only being willing to wear jewelry they hand crafted, this is not always the case. Over time, with the seperation of the Zundizar from the Dunirr, a respect for mental strength has grown as well. Thus to many dwarves to have one without the other is foolish, regardless of who you are. So next time you find yourself locked in an arm restle with a dwarf who seems to refuse to either beat you or let you win, know that it is no longer your bron that they're testing.

						<h3>
							Elves
						</h3>
						<p>
							<b>
								"treefolk", "windfolk", or even "moonfolk", the elves are often likened to aspects of nature due to a mix of their inherent talent for natural magic, but also for their seeming "natural" elegnace. Some choose to embrace this with living lives structured around returning to the lands that which they take. Others view this simply as being the way of the past, seeking instead to learn the depth of their talents. As such, most elven structured are built with magic, or sometimes more accurately grown with it.
								</br>
								</br>
								Elves tend to be on the taller side of humanoid races, but also among the most varied. On average an elf might be around six feet tall for either male or female, but have known to be as tall as seven and a half feet, or as short as almost four and a half feet. Regardless of height though, elves tend to put a heavy weight on the notion of creativity, due to the notion that magic is only limitted by the mind. If one can truely envision it, then one can make it happen. So with having centuries long lives, potentially upwards of almost a millenia, many take their time with showing openness and compassion to others. As despite the common place belief of elves being an overly prideful and potentially "snooty" people, it would be hard to get farther from the truth.
								</br>
								</br>
								While there of course will be some, especially among notably awful individuals of history, elves tend to take on a much more parental view towards other races. Some elves may reach to living upwards of seven hundred or more years, if they devote themselves in whole to their magic, most only live to maybe five hundred at most. Thus in that time, still far outliving most, many elves take a wider view with seeing the progress most races make in a small fraction of their own life times. So many take on a view point of seeing themselves as responsible for stearing the paths others take in life. This in itself is a large part of why despite elves being seen as almost uncommon or rare, their culture and people can be found almost anywhere.

						<h3>
							Gnomes
						</h3>
						<p>
							<b>
								Standing a slight bit shorter than their hery cousins, gnomes are often seen as the brains to dwraven brawn. Often seen as being natural born tinkerers, this small and curious race descends from fae, and as such are often looked upon with a cautious gaze. However, long ago their kind split between those that ended living underground with the dwarves and those that joined the elves in their forests. It is by their hands and wit that many magical artifacts were crafted for empires of old, and pushed the bounds for forging paths into the future.
								</br>
								</br>
								Normally they are a slight bit over three feet tall, if not slightly shorter, with distinctly pointed ears and sometimes rather bushy eye brows. Though due to their fae ancestry, they are also commonly known for their rather vibrant hair colours that seem to range the entire rainbow. Most gnomes descending from those that lived with the dwarves tend to have pale and sometimes grey skin with lighter coloured hair. Meanwhile those from the forests usually have slightly tanned skin and brown to blond hair and far more vibrant eye colours than their formerly mountain dwelling counterparts.
								</br>
								</br>
								Due to their fae ancestry, their hair colour is not the only thing they inherit. As additionally they are known to commonly have a more "trickster" nature to them when they are young. While this nature may never fade, where it is directed often changes, shifting from being aimed at other mortals to instead beings of great power, or even the world itself. Thus tends to be seen as a part of a gnome's nature to 'one-up' any challange placed before, even if simply to turn the challenge back upon its origin. Though, while lables as tricksters, this is often done with a genuine desire to see what knew innovation may come and eagerness to push those around them to greater heights.

						<h3>
							Goblins
						</h3>
						<p>
							<b>
								Despite being depicted as small, ugly, and and destructive green pests by many, goblins are actually among the most widely varied among the races. The negative views most have of them are due to their faral counterparts. For there is a belief held that goblins had at one point actually been of the same fae that eventually became gnomes, but were twisted, corrupted, and cursed. It is because of this that during the events following the schism, most goblins flocked to seeking shelter under the giants. Yet this also may well have aided to the hatred from and towards them. As even under the guidence of the giants, much of goblin culture for a long time hinged around agression and anger for all the wrongs done to their people.
								</br>
								</br>
								In spite of the depictions of goblins having almost demonic like fatial features, thin mouths with rows of jagged teeth, pig like noses, deep set glowing red eyes, and looking like their skin has been stretched over their sulls, most look less evil. The majority of goblin kind actually have their appearances almost more likened to cats. Standing at around three feet, they tend to have large pointed ear that move in conjunction to their current mood, have skin colours almost as wide ranging as their gnomish cousins' hair colours, and some may even have tails. While one clan may appear one way, another clan might look about as similar as trying to compare orcs and humans. However, opposite of gnomes, that can in theory live forever, goblin life is short and generally seen as disposable.
								</br>
								</br>
								Even before the schism, most goblins lives their lives in a dead sprint, reaching full adulthood in only a hand full of years, and dying not long after. This in part is due to the supposed curse upon their people, but also is heavily tied to them being pushed by most civilized races to live as either feral animals in the woods, or as slaves. So while they might have a voracious appetite for knowledge, in their world often raw strength and survival by "what ever works" comes out on top. However, that it not to say their kind is without hope. As while there are many that still live wild lives, giving in to the curse on their lineage, there do exist many goblins in the modern day that have found a better life. Thus it is not unheard of for goblins of the Gnok people, or their descendants that have spread across the world, to live as long as many humans might.

						<h3>
							Humans
						</h3>
						<p>
							<b>
								Potentially somewhat surprisingly to any not from Fluia or versed in its history, humans are believed to be the descendants of dragons. To most this comes more in the metaphorical form, with humans having be the main people of Rake culture and who populated the dragon empire before it collapse. However, to others, especially those that have met dragons choosing to take a humanoid form, there maye be reason to believe there is a more literal side to this eledged ancestry. As while they have an appearance almost more akin to that of a shrunken giant, this supposedly comes from a conflict that existed between the two celestial tribes, with dragons taking amusement in mocking giants.
								</br>
								</br>
								With a height averaging between five and a half feet to just over six feet tall, humans arguably look like the melting pot of every other race. Truthfully there isn't much to say that is not already known. Their hair colours general range between blonde, brown, and red, but may take on other colours if possibly having some gnomish ancestry. Typically human skin colours

			<h2 welcome> The Uncommon Races </h2>
			<p body>
				<b>
					Those that fall among the "uncommon" or "exotic" races are also often known as belonging to the "remnant" races. As when the Schism happened, there were many who survived that did not belong to the four main tribes, but still lived in areas protected by them or were sheltered by them. Thus they now live on as remnants of the vastly more diverse world that Fluia once was before the schism. So while the statement of the below being only the most common view points, these peoples are often either far more diverse, or tend to choose to simply integrate with those of a common race that they live close to.
