					In the lands of Fluia, there are only a handful of dieties. While there do exist spirits, "lesser gods", or demigods of the lands and of different tribes, villages, and even some aspects of the world that are offered homage and prayed to, they do not rise to the level of true godhood. Of the true gods that do exist, having seemingly risen to their grandure out of the void that is the Dark Era, there are seven. However, each of the seven is known to express themselves in many different ways, as their own aspects shift across the different natures of what they uphold to reign over different domains. Thus while two cultures may be beholden to the same prime deity, the aspect of that deity they may revere will most likely be different and as such depicted and worshipped vastly differently. As such, while no one god belongs to a singular people, each god is more frequently depicted with aspects of one ancestry than of any other.

					The sun goddess, also known as the lustful dragon, is one of the most promonant gods across all of Fluia. Despite her name, she is not actually associated to the domain of passion. Instead her monicure comes from her eternally chasing after the tempermental trickster moon goddess. 
					</br>
					She is the goddess of light, hope, and warmth in all aspects. Her pride and eagerness to achieve whatever she sets her mid to is a core aspect of her identity as a god. From the painting of the sky in sunrise, to mark the beginning of a new day

					The moon goddess, also known as the sly elf, is only slightly less commonly followed than her lover across Fluia. Eternally she dances and runs from Zeneta, hiding behind their children to tease the other and stoke the other's flames. Though what is most commonly meant in jest and desire, may some times turn more sinister. Yet even despite her non-stop game with the sun goddess, she can still be seen at times slinking into the domain of brighter half to ensure that the lustful dragon still knows her sly elf holds her close. 
					</br>
					She is the goddess of love, imagination, and opposites.
