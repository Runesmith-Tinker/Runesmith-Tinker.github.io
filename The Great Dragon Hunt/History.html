			<h1 header style="font-family: 'Almendra'"> History of Fluia </h1>
			<h2 The Schism> The Schism </h2>
			<p body>
				<b>
					Long ago Fluia used to be part of a much larger world that thrived with primal life and magic flowed effortlessly. The gods supposedly walked among men, watching them and caring for them like parents watching their children grow. Yet something happened to disturb this golden age, as the gods of old were brought low and a darkness spread across the world. One by one the old gods were felled and with each pillar of the world left unsupported the delicate balance of reality began to fray at the edges. Eventually things had gone too far, and the world was rent asunder with much of it being returned to the primordial soup of an unformed universe. However, a fragment of that world was instead cast astray into the Astral sea, eventually finding a new home plane all of its own.
					</br>
					</br>
					This is at least the generally believed and upheld notion of what happened around one and a half thousand years ago to lead to the current state of the world. As some researchers have studied the shattered remnant of the world, and its curved state does suggest that it once was part of a larger round planet. In fact some giants and dragons of old have even attested to recalling vaguely what the world before was like. However, just about any information outside of simple eyewitness claims from ancient beings about the lost world seemed to have been lost with the schism.
					</br>
					</br>
					Though, another name suggesting something far worse than just the prime material plane being affected does exist. As among Realmwalkers that live the daring and risky life of travelling across the planes, The Schism has instead been called The Sundering. Similar to what happened to the prime material plane being ripped apart and only a fragment being left, so too were many other planes also shattered.
				</b>
			</p>

			<h2 The Dark Era> The Dark Era </h2>
			<p body>
				<b>
					Following The Schism, there are somewhere between three hundred and four hundred years of unrecorded history. The only form of documentation as to what happened are myths and legends passed down by word of mouth. However, it is said that it was during this time that each of the four tribes that managed to remain intact during essentially the end of the world took in many other races. Even the foulest of dragons, the most uncaring of giants, the most suspicious of dwarves, and the most prideful of elves relented at the beginning of this time of sheer pandemonium. As when all things are about to end, and none will be spared, it takes very little for each to set aside their differences in a simple hope of feeling some comfort before annihilation.
					</br>
					</br>
					This time of peace did not last long though. Historians believe from what has been described that it lasted maybe ten to twenty years as many were twisted and warped by the wild magics of the lands. Eventually though, as the world seemed to settle back into some form of order, there were wars for power. It was in this time with such vast amounts of magic that new gods took rise. Each of the tribes had champions that led their charge to lay claim to what was left of the world, in one way or another. Yet in the end it was the group of six individuals known as the current gods in all their forms that came out above all others, regardless of which tribe they might have belonged to before.
					</br>
					</br>
					Sadly, as stated, this all comes as simply an attempt to piece together a wholly unknown narrative based on vague legends of the different tribes and the existence of the current six gods. 
				</b>
			</p>

			<h2 The Dragon Era> The Dragon Era </h2>
			<p body>
				<b>
					After whatever events had transpired during The Dark Era, it is at least known what the outcome was. Of the four tribes, the two <a href="./Nations/Cultures/Cultures.html" style="color:black;">Celestial Tribes</a> were known to be much stronger than the two <a href="./Nations/Cultures/Cultures.html" style="color:black;">Earthly Tribes</a>. Yet the peoples that made up the Celestial Tribes, the dragons of the Rake and the giants of the Solkug, were significantly fewer in number than the peoples of the Earthly Tribes, the dwarves of the Dunirr and the elves of the Trow. The importance of this matters in the question of why it was that out of the end of the Dark Era that an empire led by the Rake tribe seemed to swiftly wash across the lands with little opposition. In turn, the most common belief is that with the strongest of the six gods being of dragon blood, that the Rake and their draconic lords felt invigorated by the notion that it would be their people that were meant to bring order to the world.
					</br>
					</br>
					To the far north, the giants seemed to care very little about conflict with the dragons, and so simply receded further into the frozen wastes that the Rake had no interest in. Thus no opposition came to their laying claim to the entirety of the western continent falling under draconic rule in a matter of years. This formed the foundation of the dragon empire, built upon the backs of scholars and enslaved "monster" races. The scholars lead the way in the field of creating a new type of magic that was stable and could be used consistently for more than simply combat. The slaves paved the road as the main work force used for the building of their massive cities and were placed at the front lines of their armies as fodder with no choice but to fight or die.
					</br>
					</br>
					For a little over a century the dragon empire reigned over the western continent of Fluia, even resulting in its modern name of Drackus and thus the term Drackiot for those from the west. The east in turn came to be known as Elwhar, quite literally derived from the shortening of "elsewhere", and the term Elwharan for those from the Eastern lands. Over the span of the empire's rise in the west, and the time it spent sitting idle and developing, the east was far from quiet. War raged between the Trow and Dunirr people. The elves of the Trow favoured fostering the divine and occult so that it might lead to a higher enlightenment, but to do so required spreading and learning more about what was left of the world. The dwarves of the Dunirr on the other hand saw a world that needed to be seized and bound in place before it fell back into the chaos that had almost destroyed everything. This conflict was known as The Endless War of the Night, as many believe the animosity born by this conflict between the long lived descendants of the Trow and Dunirr lives on even to modern times between many of those from their descendant cultures.
					</br>
					</br>
					This conflict would in turn eventually become the cause for the downfall of both tribes. As the dragon to the west had little desire to simply sit idly by while there was more of the world not claimed as part of their treasure. Moreover, they had one thing that neither the Dunirr nor Trow had, and that was the ability to cross the ocean between the two lands. It was early in the 133rd year of The Dragon Era, referred to at the time as the Dawn Era, that dragon riders were reportedly first sighted having crossed the Metab ocean that spanned between the Drackus continent and the Elwhar continent. They levelled villages of Trow and Dunirr alike without discrimination, claiming slaves from any that they did not simply wipe out. Each at first pointed fingers at the other. The elves believed the rounded eared individuals to simply be a taller breed of dwarf, riding atop a new war beast tamed in their damned mountains. The dwarves in turn believed these tall people to simply be a bread of elf with round ears that rode atop some new monstrosity birthed from their cursed magics.
					</br>
					</br>
					It did not take long for the two people to realize that the new threat from beyond the coast belonged to neither of their tribes. The first summit was held in their decades long war, in aim to address the matter of a foreign force seeming to be interfering with their own conflict. For the briefest moment, this almost seemed to open the chance that the invasion of the Rake people and the Dragon Empire might in fact bring an end to The Endless War of the Night. Yet in accounts recorded from the summit, the elven ambassadors had proposed that the Dunirr people come under the wing of the Trow, as such together combine their strength against the outside force. This in turn was promptly laughed at, with the dwarven ambassadors remarking on how the new force only had an interest in the surface, and so all they needed to do was return to their homes below and wait for the elves to be burned away. So ended the first, and seemingly last, chance that the Trow and Dunirr had to actually fight against the invading armies. As only weeks after the conference, the Rake warships landed on their shores, offloading several tens of thousands of war slaves and thousands to low tens of thousands of soldiers.
					</br>
					</br>
					While battles between the Dunirr and the Trow lessened, their conflict with the Rake peoples grew. Over the nearly four hundred years that The War of Wyvern raged, a total of seven hundred and twelve more conferences happened. Nearly two hundred years in though, there was divide among the people of the Trow, with many wishing to continue following the old ways, but many seeing they were losing the war. Thus rose the Eldar peoples, who chose to abandon the ancient magics of Orophet in favour of using the structured magics of Agnosti known by the Rake. While the old magic was incredibly powerful, it also was highly volatile and almost uncontrollable, while the newer magic could be studied and built upon despite its less powerful base. Not long after, the orkish Ulguk tribe broke from the Dunirr dwarves, seeing their choice to hide from the dragons as cowardice and spitting in the face of Kylnvar. They wanted to either taste the blood of their enemies, or die happily in "glorious" combat with a worthy enemy.
					</br>
					</br>
					Six hundred years after the end of the dark era, the last summit of the War of the Wyvern was held. Not between the Trow and Dunirr, but instead between the Rake, The Eldar, and the Dunirr. The elves had done what they could to oppose the dragons, their riders, and their armies, but their will to fight had been broken from endlessly watching their cities be levelled and their people slaughtered. Thus even entering the summit that the dwarves believed would once more be a futile discussion between their kind and the elves, the Eldar ambassadors entered with hung heads. Behind them followed their new masters and lords, the human ambassadors of the Rake. The elven ambassadors were forced to sit for an entire day watching as the emissaries of the Rake tortured each of the dwarves, leaving only a single one alive at the end to return to his people and advise his lords to submit to the Rake or worse would come. In turn, the elves were told that it was wise of them to submit willingly, and thus why they would be spared such treatment.
					</br>
					</br>
					Shortly after, just about everything that the dragon empire had built up began to come crumbling back down. As with the end of the war, there was peace and even prosperity for a while. Many of the dragons were cruel lords that wished nothing more than to hoard wealth and power. Others though had an actual interest in overseeing the well being of their people. Yet after a decade and a half, and a year after the last remnants of rebellion fell away, so to vanished the interest in ruling that the majority of the draconic lords saw fit to. Any sense of allegiance they felt with one another turned to dust. Those that had spent centuries carving a path forward, driven simply by their own greed and a desire to show that they could rule over everything felt they had achieved just that. And so most of the lords of the great dragon empires in essence simply decided they were satisfied and wished to return home rather than actually ruling. To this day even, many dragons raid villages and demand tithes from nearby towns and cities out of a view that those living there are still citizens of the long gone empire that they ruled over.

			<h2 The Wild Era> The Wild Era </h2>
			<p body>
				<b>
					What took over six centuries to build up, took less than five years to completely fall apart. A little over three quarters of the draconic lords simply vanished from their seats of power, leaving the other quarter to struggle to try and hold everything they had created together. Yet in the vacuum of power there were endless foes seeking to fill it. Some wished for a return to the old ways, with it having only been a couple decades since. Hardly a blink of an eye for peoples that could live several centuries. For many others though, the old ways had been stripped bare and torn down by the war and the dragon empire, and thus wished to push on and make something new. Across the face of Fluia this conflict gripped just about everywhere and everyone in its clutches.
					</br>
					</br>
					On Elwhar the descent was quick. The Eldar moved to try and reclaim their lands while the dwarves found themselves divided. Those following the old codes of the Dunirr wished to return to their homes below ground and hold claim over their cultural homeland. However, a large faction of dwarves and many orcs, now more thoroughly exposed to the ways of other peoples and especially the Eldar after they had been humbled by the dragons, wished to continue engaging with the rest of the world. These individuals eventually came to be known as the Zundizar people. Yet in turn, to the north there were still raging hordes led by Ulguk orcs and the remnants of former leaders of the dragon empire. In the south there was the mounting attempts to start new nations by the Eldar, Trow, and many that still wanted the order the dragon empire had granted the world, but simply without the tyrant dragons on top.
					</br>
					</br>
					To the west, on Drackus, things took a little longer to fall apart for a few different reasons. The first was simply the time that it took for news of their success in the East to dominate the Earthly tribes, and second was the fact that the eastern continent was the home the dragons were returning to. It took nearly a decade more for what had been established by the Rake people in their homeland to disintegrate. There were some that maintained a loyalty to their former draconic rulers, keeping in mind that their prime god was of draconic blood, and the peace that had reigned under their tyranny. Thus they chose to remain guarding the heart of their empire, even after it had been levelled.
					</br>
					</br>
					For the rest, they splintered in twain. A mostly elven faction of the Rake tribe took to the north with offering an uneasy alliance with the giants and setting free their slaves, who in turn fled even further north to seek protection from those same giants. These eventually became the Quenian people, descending from Rake tradition, and the Gnok people who inherited Solkug tradition. The Quenian sought to mend the wounds of the past and desired to still maintain a form of stability, but with a focus on uplifting all peoples, rather than crushing and controlling them. Meanwhile the other group that was mostly human spread across the remainder of what was left of the dragon empire, declaring themselves as the Dulandir, literally translating as "rightful rulers." Their culture was built on a notion of reclaiming what was lost through sheer force and ruling with an iron grip in place of the laziness of the dragons before them. 
					</br>
					</br>
					Each continent burned and ran with blood as a seemingly ceaseless slew of nameless battles and wars ravaged the lands. It took hundreds of years for any semblance of peace to reform. All the while it seemed like there was at any time the possibility of Fluia being plunged into another Dark Era. Almost every city that the dragon empire had built was destroyed with their libraries being burned along with just about everything else. As such, hundreds of years of magical research was lost and artifacts of the nation being scattered far and wide. Thus in the modern day, despite arcane magic being seen as "dragon magic," the lost magics of the dragon empire are still highly sought after.
					</br>
					</br>
					The Quenians found some peace with the giants, but were told to never settle anything larger than a village farther north than a certain point, with that land being given for the Gnok people that still held a deep grudge. From them also split the Anor people, a mostly human culture that was heavily influenced by the ways of the Solkug tribe. Their divergence was mostly due to the shorter life spans of humans and thus faster changes that would occur chronologically from one generation to another. To the modern day both cultures have as a part of them a desire to make amends with the peoples that were once slaves to the dragon empire, even if most others across the world still see them as little more than monsters.
					</br>
					</br>
					Meanwhile those that had turned to the Dulandir found their anger at their former rulers and passion to control everything quickly dying down with each human generation. Thus before long, much of their customs either returned to the more positive aspects of the Rake, or became something new and promoted a more constructive way of living rather than a destructive one. While not all negative values were vanquished, as all cultures have their darker side, the now named Rohand people sought for a more stable and accepting way of living. As such, they accepted a heavy level of influence from their Quenian brothers and sisters to the north. In the east this went even further, with those that might call themselves Rohand accepting even more influence from even more people. So out of the ashes of the possibly the cruellest portion of the dragon empire rose the Reabing people, that while most human, were also essentially the true melting pot of almost all cultures.
					</br>
					</br>
					The Zundizar and Dunirr each mostly moved to the mountains and deep underground, but fairly far from one another. While the Dunirr chose to close themselves off to all outsiders, the Zundizar on the other hand aimed to keep an open mind and engage with others. This similarly was reflected in the orc peoples that followed each, with the Ulguk tribes still laying claim to a portion of central Elwhar. However, the orcish peoples of the Zundizar eventually broke off of their own accord in order to try and pull more of their kind from the Ulguk tribes into a more peaceful life. Taking heavy influence from the openness of the Reabing people, they eventually came to be known as the wandering tribes of the Ulkon peoples.
					</br>
					</br>
					In the southern portion of Elwhar though, the trow were forced into living in the far south, seen as all but out casts that consisted only of moon witches and sea hags. Despite how they were portrayed by their branching cultural descendants, their people still practiced their rites with pride and did what they could to lend their magic to help others. However, for the Eldar, the divide between returning to the old and moving forwards to something new sank deep. Thus in the south there were many warring elven nations for almost the entire stretch of the Wild Era as one fell, another would crop up, endlessly churning until they found something that seemed to work.
					</br>
					</br>
					Eventually, as the many countries, warbands, tribes, and factions that rose out of the fall of the dragon empire toiled, eventually an end would come. The several, by one means or another, became the few. Where there were nearly a hundred different countries across the remaining fragment of Fluia, thirteen rose out of the dust. The end of the Wild Era is generally seen as being heralded by the last conflict that happened with the Kingdom of Xendros. In which the Arch Duchess Estella Lithfyre decided to break away from what was at the time the cruel rulership of the Xendros royal family.

			<h2 The Peaceful Era> The Peaceful Era </h2>
			<p body>
				<b>
					After nearly five hundred years the first semblance of actual calm since the iron gripping "peace" of the dragon empire found its way into the world. While there were still some land disputes here and there, and skirmishes with warbands from either the Dulandir or Ulguk, depending on the continent, there were no greater wars. The differences between the Eldar peoples were settled with the rise of Prince Vianar Olon forming the Principality of Olon on the values of the old ways, and those that wished to push forwards formed the Free Cities of Else. The Quenian and Anor peoples formed the Republic of Thila, and a bit further north the Sheq'Anian Diarchy led by a monarch of Quenian descent and a monarch of Anor descent, but who ruled with the advice of the giants of the north. To the south, the Rohand peoples divided into three nations due to a dispute near the end of the Wild Era between three potential heirs to the throne of what was seen as the last "true remnant" of the Dragon empire. Each wished to lead the people within the territory they'd been given, but each one had no desire to inherit the mantle and legacy of the former empire. 
					</br>
					</br>
					That brings us all the way to the current day, only a little over a century into what has been so far labelled as the Peaceful Era. Despite this being the view on a global scale, many places still face strife of their own and conflicts that simply do not land on the scale of being seen by all, let alone most. Some worry that the declaration of the hunt for legendary dragons may destabilise the brief glimpse of quiet that has been seen across the world so far. Others see it as a chance to further cement a true age of lasting prosperity all across the world.
