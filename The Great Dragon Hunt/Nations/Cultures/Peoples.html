			<h1 header style="font-family: 'Almendra'"> The Peoples of Fluia </h1>
			<p style="font-size:1.25em;">
				The Great Dragon Hunt was written as a setting for a Pathfinder 2e campain. As such, all races below are at least somewhat connected to their PF2e counter part, and will have a link to their Archives of Nethys counterpart. The full list can be found <a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Ancestries.aspx">here</a>
				</br>
				Potentially of more importance, what is below are simply the most common beliefs and views about each race of people. None of them are truely without exception, especially after hundreds of years for races and cultures to intermingle and interact.
			</p>
			<h2 welcome> The Common Races </h2>
				<p>
					<b>
						The peoples known to be among the "common races" are those you may expect to see every day, filling out the crowds you see at the markets or fellow patrons at taverns and inns. Having spread far and wide all across Fluia, most nations are controlled and lead by people of one or mutliple of these races. They are also seen as being the primary descendants of the four ancient tribes that sruvived the Schism.

						<h3>
							Dwarves
						</h3>
						<p>
							<b>
								Stout and sturdy folk, known for their love of the mountains and claim to the depth of the world. On a gneral basis dwarves are often seen as a seclusive race, opting to live only with their own people rather than around others. In fact, many Dunirr settlements actively prohibit entry without a dwarf to watch over those being let in or will simply deny non dwarves entry all together.
								</br>
								Most dwarves stand at around four to almost five feet tall, with men having pride in their long bears, and women in think lussious braided hair. Being people "of the land", many of them can often be seen to wear many different kinds of jewelery in their hair. Though while beards and hair may be things of person al pride and gender affirmation among their ilk, something universal to their people is that strength is what is seen as truly attractive. Typically this is most often in the form of physical strength, with many dwarves only being willing to wear jewelry they hand crafted, this is not always the case.
								</br>
								ver time, with the seperation of the Zundizar from the Dunirr, a respect for mental strength has grown as well. Thus to many dwarves to have one without the other is foolish, regardless of who you are. So next time you find yourself locked in an arm restle with a dwarf who seems to refuse to either beat you or let you win, know that it is no longer your bron that they're testing.

						<h3>
							Elves
						</h3>
						<p>
							<b>
								"treefolk", "windfolk", or even "moonfolk", the elves are often likened to aspects of nature due to a mix of their inherent talent for natural magic, but also for their seeming "natural" elegnace.

			<h2 welcome> The Uncommon Races </h2>
			<p body>
				<b>
					Those that fall among the "uncommon" or "exotic" races are also often known as belonging to the "remnant" races. As when the Schism happened, there were many who survived that did not belong to the four main tribes, but still lived in areas protected by them or were sheltered by them. Thus they now live on as remnants of the vastly more diverse world that Fluia once was before the schism. So while the statement of the below being only the most common view points, these peoples are often either far more diverse, or tend to choose to simply integrate with those of a common race that they live close to.
