				Having lived as long if not longer than the oldest of dragons, giants have seen the world turn over and and over. As the world spins, and the revolves around the sun, the old becoming new and then old once again, all things have their cycles. This is the nature of all things as viewed by the seemingly unaging eyes of the giants. It is why they choose to remove themselves from interfering with just about all things, knowing that if they were to prevent what is meant to happen from happening, it may irreversably damage the patterns of nature. Thus when one takes, one must give. When one destroys, one must create. Where there is life, there will always then be death. This is not an excuse for simply being idle, but a mindset that should be held when one chooses to act. As those of the Solkug do not simply sit idly when then purposeful destruction of an important cycle is to happen, but neither should they choose to act to prevent the naturally destructive end of a cycle that will give rise to a new iteration.

						The defining of a cycle is a difficult task that often takes many life times to observe. In this essence, patience is a vitrue valued above almost all other things by those of the Solkug. Patience to see what will happen, and patience with one's self to accept what is. Thus simply living a natural life with no desire to break from what the threads of fate seem to lay out before one is seen as a positive thing. Because of this, many of the Solkug who are not giants tend to find their way to being druids, tending to the lands and living without desire to overly connect themselves to any one thing. If one does grow attached to something though, then it is advised to take time and observe before trying to stear the path of something one cares about. As sometimes it is best to simply accept the path something is on will lead to its end, than to try and prevent it at risk of an unknown outcome.

						To many, this ‘outsiders watching inwards’ appearance of those of the Solkug comes off almost like they see themselves on par with the gods. Not in terms of power or dominion, but instead in disconnection. Seeing them as having little care for the world, and choosing simply to follow a nihilistic path of simply standing by to watch as all things burn and crumble. However, this often leads to great suprise when those of the Solkug do finally choose to step in, showing far greater care than one might have anticipated. As while they may stand by and watch from the sidelines when time permits, this is only to ensure that when they act, it can be to great effect and without unforeseen ill repercussions.
						</br>
						</br>
						Having been around during the Dark Era, the depictions of the gods left in ruins of giant settlements before they fully receded into the north are cited by many scholars as the most true depictions of them. This comes for a few reasons, with the first being as started with the giants having been present to witness them. Beyond this, it is believed that any attempt to purposefully alter from the truth could be seen as a form of attempting to affect and direct the future, directly standing in opposition to a core belief of the Solkug. How true these notions are is hard to verify, given the isolated nature of the giants of the Solkug. Even in spite of this, there have been findings of a rare few temples, seemingly built in by the giants in honour of the twin god of life and death. In whole though, these depictions match quite closely to the current commonly held views of how each of the gods look, with some artistic liberties accounted for.

			<h2 The Eldar> The Gnok </h2>
			<p body>
				<b>
				Often seen as a twisting and embittering of the views of the Solkug, many believe that Gnok culture is based around the continuing of the cycle of hatred and violence, but to be the one causing it and not receiving it. However, in truth it is a culture grown from those who have never known anything but the painful end of a whip or the sharp end of a blade, yet want only to bring an end to what they see as unnecessary cycles. To the Solkug they are a lost people, blindly stumbling through the dark who must find their own way, even if it means simply repeating the same acts of hatred that they wish to prevent. However, since the beginning of the peaceful era, there have been some signs of improvement as those of the Gnok have pushed more to try and properly interact with those of other cultures.
