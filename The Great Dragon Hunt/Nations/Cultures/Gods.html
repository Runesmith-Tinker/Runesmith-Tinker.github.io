				<b>
					In the lands of Fluia, there are only a handful of true dieties. While there do exist spirits, lesser "gods", or demigods of the lands and of different tribes, villages, and even some aspects of the world that are offered homage and prayed to, they do not rise to the level of true godhood. Of the true gods that do exist, having seemingly risen to their grandure out of the void that is the Dark Era, there are six. However, each of the six is known to express themselves in many different ways, as their own aspects shift across the different natures of what they uphold to reign over different domains. Thus while two cultures may be beholden to the same prime deity, the aspect of that deity they may revere will most likely be different and as such depicted and worshipped vastly differently. As such, while no one god belongs to a singular people, each god is more frequently depicted with aspects of one ancestry and gender than of any other.

			<h2 Zenetta> Zenetta </h2>
			<p>
				<b>
					The sun goddess, also known as the lustful dragon, is one of the most promonant gods across all of Fluia. Despite her name, she is not actually associated to the domain of passion. Instead her monicure comes from her eternally chasing after the tempermental trickster moon goddess. Yet even through her desire to be with the one that she loves, she still takes the time to watch over the world and give light to those needing it for work. As such, most laborers and dayworkers will often wear pendants marked with either her Zenith of Setting symbol. It is also not uncommon for adventurers to addorn their armour with symbols of her Rising aspect, with this sometimes causing conflict to it being a common symbol used by nobility of Rake descent. 
					</br>
					</br>
					Zenetta is typically depicted as a tall woman of athletic build with tanned bronze skin with several scars, patches of golden scales, fiery sun-like eyes, a pair of curved draconic horns abover her forehead arching back over her head and then up, and wavy flowing dark red or gold hair. In paintings and statues she normally wears tighter fitting clothing that is somewhat minimalistic in design, and somtimes with her having large gold dragon wings. She is the goddess of light, hope, and warmth in all aspects. Her pride and eagerness to achieve whatever she sets her mind to is a core aspect of her identity as a god. From the painting of the sky every sunrise, to mark the beginning of a new day, all the way to her restlessly chasing her love into the dark unknown of night. It is her light that guides all into a brighter future and out of the darkness of the past.

			<h2 Orophet> Orophet </h2>
			<p>
				<b>
					The moon goddess, also known as the sly elf, is only slightly less commonly followed than her lover across Fluia. Eternally she dances and runs from Zenetta, hiding behind their children to tease the other and stoke the other's flames. Though what is most commonly meant in jest and desire, may some times turn more sinister. Yet even despite her non-stop game with the sun goddess, she can still be seen at times slinking into the domain of brighter half to ensure that the lustful dragon still knows her sly elf holds her close. Thus it may be common to see her symbols hung from taverns, brothels, and the homes of newly weds.
					</br>
					</br>
					Orphette is typically depicted as a dainty and eerily beautiful elven woman with almost paper white skin, silvery hair, and deep sapphire eyes. In paintings and statues she is normally wearing long flowing robes that tend to be reflective, or black and silver. She is the goddess of love, imagination, and the ocean. Just as Zenetta paints the sky gorgeous shades orange and purple at dawn and dusk, Orophet spackles the nights with shimmering stars. It is in her wild creativity that many find their first steps into learning most find their first steps into learning magic.

			<h2 Anador&Rodana> Anador & Rodana </h2>
			<p>
				<b>
					The twin nature god, also known as the landstriders, is one of the few gods you will almost never find a temple for of any kind, but who has shrines all across the lands. For druids, hunters, adventurers, and just about any known to wander far and wide, depictions of The Landstriders' symbol are often a welcome sight. One of Their core tenets is that no form of life can truly survive entirely on it's own, and thus to give to others just as you take from the wilds. Though if seen carved into the side of a cave rather than into the door of a cottage, it may be best to turn back before you find yourself facing nature's wrath.
					</br>
					</br>
					Anador is typically depicted as a tall well built healthy young human-like man with lightly tanned skin, shoulder length oak brown hair, and emerald green eyes. Rodana is typically depicted as a short and sometimes sickly young human-like woman with ashen skin, waist length dark brown and grey hair, and earthy brown-green eyes. In paintings and statues both are normally wearing earthy or plant based coloured attire, but with Anador normally being dressed for spring or summer while Rodana appears dressed more for fall or winter with a snake resting on her shoulders.They are the god of the natural order, life, death, and travelers. Like two sides of a coin, one simply cannot be without the other, and thus in spite of being often seen as two figures, they are still only one god. It is from their harmony that adventurers and travelers are tought to keep in mind that where Anador lead, Rodana follows, and thus where there is life there will always be death, and it is not necessarily a bad thing.

			<h2 Okarine> Okarine </h2>
			<p>
				<b>
					The Sky godd, also known as the Lightning of the North, is most commonly prayed to by those looking for a change in their life, be it large or small. Her temples tend to offer aid to those undergoing some form of transition period in their life and are seeking aid in either understanding or support. There are many legends about how while the sun godess was the leader of the six, it was the sky godess that encouraged them all. Thus while she is associated with change, she is also frequently depicted alongside Agnosti on the matter of changing into being a truer version of one's self. Though because of this, and some spoken legends of old, she has also come to be seen as a patron godess of transgender individuals.
					</br>

					(Placeholder) - typically depicted as a young and lively feminine humanoid with light blue hair and blue eyes that seem to sparkle lightly.

Be it wearing almost nothing at all except jewelry for clear, wearing more fall to winter clothing for cloudy, or possibly even weating armour sparking with lightning for stormy. However, she is often depicted as being trans-fem as a form of showing change.
