			<h2 Dunirr> The Dunirr </h2>
			<p body>
				<b>
				Selfish, Belligerent, and Stubborn. These are the three words that most commonly come to the minds of any when the Dunirr are brought up. The dwarven people of "the old ways" also do little to nothing to ever disuade people of seeing them as such. Those who hold fast to the views of the first dwarven clans see all the lands of Fluia as being up for grabs if one pushes hard enough. As such, they hold away in their underground fortresses, rejecting any "lessers" from being permitted entry without putting up a fight. They forge their approach to any situation using beliefs wrought from Kylnvar's aspect of the blade, with being willing to level anything or anyone they see as standing in their way. Yet at the same time, it is because of this very stubborn pride, that more and more Dunirr dwarves have been noted leaving their cities and seeking to see what the world actually holds, be it simply to learn, or to conquer.

						All Dunirr are dwarves, but not all dwarves have what it takes to be <i><u>Dunirr</u></i>. This is the sentiment held and repeated by those of the "true descendants" of the Dwarven Earthly clan, passed down from parents to children, generation to generation. As a stubborn Dunirr is a proud Dunirr. Not just sticking to their beliefs and plugging their ears, but showing their beliefs trump all others by force. This last part is why Dunirr do not live in true isolation, but instead forge out into the world to show their might to others, proving that they are in fact superior. After all, it is not the belief of their peopel that they should be the <i>only</i> people on the lands of Fluia. Simply that their people should be the ones to stand above all others in ruling over the lands. As such, there are some generally positive values pushed to their people, often on the point of good leadership skills, as a firm hand controlling one's subordinates won't resolve problems originating from the one leading the way.
						</br>
						</br>
						Beyond the secretive fortresses of the Dunirr peoples, the dwarves that reside within often look like little more than pigheaded fools with rocks for brains. Their iconography often depicts ravionous dwarven warriors trampling over those of other nations and cultures, leaving nothing but rivers of blood in their wake. Thus more than a handful of tales of the mindless hoard hidden below the Xendros's Divide Mountain range, waiting in their endless winding tunnels for the day to burst fourth and lay waste to the lands. Yet while the Dunirr may take pride in their hardheadedness, they are also far from braindead fools. As even if they might be stuborn and unwilling to view others as ever their betters, those of the Dunirr do listen and learn. From a young age they are taught not to scoff at the views of others, but learn what could give them strength, and to then make it their own. For this reason, while they might often be unpleasant to work with, Dunirr dwarves are actually not all to uncommon to find in positions of power or leadership. Though, this often is with someone else still higher up watching over them.
						</br>
						</br>
						Throughout the ages, the only culture to have had a more constant view of the gods has been the Solkug. However, unlike the giants, the Dunirr depict the gods through the lens of how they see each of the ideals the gods uphold should be seen. Through thise filter Zenetta, or Zen'toriq as he is called instead, is a fire haird dwarf with almost ebony skin, and eyes like the sun and a relentless spirit to burn away the impurities of the world. In turn, Orophette, instead known os Ophiucus, is a seen to be a slender and fragile elven woman eternally fleeing Zen'toriq's might, with nothing but petty tricks to escape him. Okarine, referred to as Karthis, is shown often purposefully instultingly as a weak willed and dainty human man with stubble and uncemped hair, dressing in scant female attire. Anador and Rodana, named instead as Ynvol and Lovny, are shown as a singular two faced dwarven woman, in one hand holding a glowing emerald that can grant life, and in the other an axe dripping with blood to end life. As for Agnosti, his name remains the same, but depictions of him are often in the form of an obelisk of pure diamond, etched with words of wisdom. Then lastly, Kylnvar too remains unchanged in name, and with only the difference of his shield often having hung from it the heads of several non-dwarven races. Even to the modern day, their depictions have only shiften in the smallest of ways.

	  		<h2 Zundizar> The Zundizar </h2>
			<p body>
				<b>
					The flip side of the dwarven coin from the Dunirr. While at one point having descended from the Dunirr people, those of the Zundizar broke away after the dragon empire's utter domination of the Elwhar continent. Having seen the uncaring nature of the tyranical dragon lords and the strength that could come from working alongside other races, rather than trying to rule them, the Zundizar took notes from the Eldar peoples. Learning of the world, of other peoples, and reaching out, they sought to strengthen their bonds with those they might call friends, rather than underlings. There is still a strong dwarven pride had by their people within their homelands, but it is far from the closed off nature that their stuborn bretheren to the north hold. Instead the Zundizar happily invite in others to share in their culture, and form new alliances.
