			<h1 header style="font-family: 'Almendra'"> History of Fluia </h1>
			<h2 The Schism> The Schism </h2>
			<p body>
				<b>
					Long ago Fluia used to be part of a much larger world that thrived with primal life and magic flowed effortlessly. The gods supposedly walked mong men, watching them and caring for them like parents watching their children grow. Yet something happened to disturb this golden age, as the gods of old were brought low and a darkness spread across the world. One by one the old gods were felled and with each pillar of the world left unsuported the delecate balance of reality began to fray at the edges. Eventually things had gone too far, and the world was rent asunder with much of it being returned to the primordial soup of an unformed universe. However, a fragment of that world was instead cast astray into the Astral sea, eventually finding a new home plane all of its own.
					</br>
					</br>
					This is at least the generally believed and upheald notion of what happened around one and a half thousand years ago to lead to the current state of the world. As some researchers have studied the the shattered remnant of the world, and it's curved state does suggest that it once was part of a larger round planet. In fact some giants and dragons of old have even attested to recalling vaguely what the world before was like. However, just about any information outside of simple eye witness claims from ancient beings about the lost world seemed to have been lost with the schism.
					</br>
					</br>
					Though, another name suggesting something far worse than just the prime material plane being affected does exist. As among Realmwalkers that live the daring and risky life of traveling across the planes, The Schism has instead been called The Sundering. Similar to waht happened to the prime material plane being ripped apart and only a fragment being left, so too were many other planes also shattered.

			<h2 The Dark Era> The Dark Era </h2>
			<p body>
				<b>
					Following The Schism, there are somewhere between three hundred and four hundred years of unrecorded history. The only form of documentation as to what happened are myths and legends passed down by word of mouth. However, it is said that during this time was when each of the four tribes that managed to remain intact during essentially the end of the world took in many other races. Even the foulest of dragons, the most uncaring of giant, the most suspicious of dwarves, and the most prideful of elves relented at the beginning of this time of sheer pandemonium. As when all things are about to end, and none will be spared, it takes vary little for each to set aside their differences in a simple hope of feeling some comfort before annihilation.
					</br>
					</br>
					This time of peace did not last long though. Historians believe from what has been described that it lasted maybe ten to twenty years as many were twisted and warped by the wild magics of the lands. Eventually though, as the world seemed to settle back into some form of order, there were wars for power. It was in this time with such vast amounts of magic that new gods took rise. Each of the tribes had champions that lead their charge to lay claim to what was left of the world, in one way or another. It was then these champions that rose up, infused with the abundence of magic of all kinds and the faith of their people, and became the gods still worshipped to this day.
					</br>
					</br>
					Sadly, as stated, this all comes as simply an attempt to piece together a wholly unknown narrative based on vague legends of the different tribes and the existence of the current gods.

				<b>
					After whatever events had transpired during The Dark Era, it is at least known what the outcome was. Of the four tribes, the two <a href="./Nations/Cultures/Cultures.html" style="color:black;">Celestial Tribes</a> were known to be much smaller than the two <a href="./Nations/Cultures/Cultures.html" style="color:black;">Earthly Tribes</a>. Yet the peoples that made up the Celstial Tribes, the dragons of the Rake and the giants of the Solkug, were significantly stronger beings than the peoples of the Earthly Tribes, the dwarves of the Dunirr and the elves of the Trow.
