    		Also known as Drow, as miss-spelled by many, or referred to as "dark elves" in a somewhat derogatory fashion by most non-Trow elves. The Trow are what is left of the Elven Earthly tribe that their name heralds from, even if much of their culture has changed. Their people are often far more open and willing to listen than most might expect. As much of the culture forms itself around the aspects of Orophet, in believing that one should express themself openly in order to truly be understood. Many of their rituals and celebrations exist around the notion of creating together and exploring new things with those you hold close. To those outside, this often can cause their people to appear far more backwards and uncomfortably lacking of personal boundaries. This is often made even worse by their open willingness to worship all aspects of Orophet, rather than shunning her dark aspect, and continued use of the ancient elven magics that have since been labelled as dark or black magic.

        			With their value of openly showing one's passion in all forms that do not bring harm to one's self or others, it is encouraged to share your insites and views upon the things one cares about. One should always respect the way in which another person chooses to approach something, but it once experience is gained, it should be shared. However, on the flip side of this, if approaching something that you have never done before, then any first attempts should be done without supervision. For while skill is important, so too is it important to trust in the luck granted to one by the the moon goddess. This extends to the point that those of Trow culture hold a firm belief that the more passionate you are for something, the luckier you will be with it.
        			</br>
        			</br>
        			In this same vein, many other cultures often view their arts as filled with far more emotion than just about any other and their clothes much more exotic. Since the people of the Trow often wish to show and emphasise that which they dream about or hold passion in, that is what they create. Their artwork is often claimed to come alive simply from the devotion and energy put into it by its creator. Their clothes often exist less to hide parts of their body and for warmth, but instead made as yet another way to express one's self with attire designed to symbolise what one holds a true love for or dreams about. Though when one is primarily among peoples of other cultures or outside of what has become the Trow homeland, it is generally known to be more polite to at least cover one's genitals with clothing.

        			On the front of the gods, the Trow most commonly depict both Zenetta and Orophet as elven women, with the moon goddess's trickery being used so she can find her way into the daytime to be with her lover even as she watches over the world. Similar is true for most of the other gods in being depicted as elves, except for Agnosti. Instead, the knowledge god is often depicted as an animal guide with a greater emphasis upon intuitive wisdom instead of strict knowledge. Additionally, if not shown as a dwarf, Kylnvar is commonly depicted very specifically as an Eldar elf in the way he dresses and the colour of both his skin and hair. As for Anador and Rodana, the Trow people oftne depict Anador as having light skin and being female, and Rodana as having dark skin an male, but regardless of the gender each is given they are seen as lovers and not kin.

            <b>
    		Branching from the Trow, the Eldar people sit almost on the opposite end of most things from their lunar-tied ancestors. For the Eldar, knowledge is everything. Thus much of their culture revolves around the study and research of the world and of magic. In turn, writing about the world and the things one cares about, and taking time to reflect upon oneself in order to better know oneself are held in high esteem. To many other cultures this may lead them to seeing someone of the Eldar as almost mechanical, cold, or possibly over-analyzing. Yet still in their writings the influence of the culture they descend from can still be seen, as those of their people often have a knack for making accountings of historical events and reports of occurrences as intriguing to read as some of the best written novels. In turn, both similarly and dissimilarly to their ancestors, they also highly value the use of magic as a means of expressing one's self and as a means by which to show what one wishes to do with their life.

        <h4> Eldar Customs </h4>
        <input class="spoilerbutton" type="button" value="Show" onclick="this.value=this.value=='Show'?'Hide':'Show';">

                    <b>
        			To express one's self through writing is seen as one of the truest forms of expressing and understanding one's self. As a part of this belief, almost all Eldar peoples are taught from an early age to write, and given a journal in which to write about themselves. Their hopes, their dreams, how they see themselves, how they see others, or even just something they saw that was interesting that day. Anything and everything they feel is worth writing about themselves going into this journal, and thus it is seen as a sacred item to each person. In turn, sharing one's current journal to another is seen as one of the most sincere showings of affection that exists among their people. When one journal is filled, they acquire another and continue. To lose one of these journals too soon is seen as a horrible thing, almost akin to losing a piece of yourself. However, when one feels they have grown past one of their journals, then after reading through it and reflecting upon one's self to understand how they have grown, the book is burned in a ritual fire. The ashes of the old book are then mixed into the ink that is used to continue writing their current journal.
        			</br>
        			</br>
        			This cultural drive to note down anything and everything they see of even slight importance has brought many other cultures to awe of their eye for detail. It is said that to read a book written by an Eldar invokes the same sense as staring at a painting made by a Trow, with bringing you into feeling as if you are truly experiencing what is being describes. Many attribute this as being a part of the reason for why Eldar advancements to draconic magic have been some of the greatest since the fall of the dragon empire. Since aving and ability to understand and describe the world so well that one could almost envision themself in a reality where what is written is true forms a solid base for the arcane.
        			</br>
        			</br>
        			In early depictions when there was still great hatred for the dragon empire, Zenetta and Orophet were not shown as lovers. Instead Zenetta was generally depicted as a violent idiot dragons seeking to control the sly elf that always outwitted them. However, as time went on, the Eldar depictions shifted to being much like the most popular views of the gods. Some believe this to simply be a product of time and pressure from other peoples, but many also believe it to have been the direct hand of the knowledge god. As while the deific beings have seen many forms over the years, they were once still real individuals, and the depiction of that truth falls in line with Eldar Culture.
