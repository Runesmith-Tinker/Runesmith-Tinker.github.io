				<h2>
					Dwarves
				</h2>
				<p>
					<b>
						Stout and sturdy folk, known for their love of the mountains and claim to the depth of the world. On a general basis dwarves are often seen as a seclusive race, opting to live only with their own people rather than around others. In fact, many Dunirr settlements actively prohibit entry without a dwarf to watch over those being let in or will simply deny non dwarves entry altogether.
						</br>
						</br>
						Most dwarves stand at around four to almost five feet tall, with most men having pride in their long beards, and women in thick luscious braided hair. Said hair is generally dark in colour, with either being deep brown, black, or at the brightest as sharp orange. Their skin on the other hand is commonly on the pale side for those living underground, ranging to being dark grey, while above ground it can take on all the same tones human skin might. Additionally, being people "of the land", many of them can often be seen to wear many different kinds of jewellery in their hair. As while it might be denied and rejected by some dwarves, many have an innate talent for earthen magics.
						</br>
						</br>
						Though beards and hair may be things of personal pride and gender affirmation among their ilk, something universal to their people is that strength is what is seen as truly attractive. Typically this is most often in the form of physical strength, with many dwarves only being willing to wear jewellery they hand crafted, this is not always the case. Over time, with the separation of the Zundizar from the Dunirr, a respect for mental strength has grown as well. Thus to many dwarves to have one without the other is foolish, regardless of who you are. So next time you find yourself locked in an arm wrestle with a dwarf who seems to refuse to either beat you or let you win, know that it is no longer your brawn that they're testing.

				<h2>
					Elves
				</h2>
				<p>
					<b>
						"Treefolk", "windfolk", or even "moonfolk", the elves are often likened to aspects of nature due to a mix of their inherent talent for natural magic, but also for their seeming "natural" elegance. Some choose to embrace this with living lives structured around returning to the lands that which they take. Others view this simply as being the way of the past, seeking instead to learn the depth of their talents. As such, most elven structures are built with magic, or sometimes more accurately grown with it.
						</br>
						</br>
						Elves tend to be on the taller side of humanoid races, but also among the most varied. On average an elf might be around six feet tall for either male or female, but have been known to be as tall as seven and a half feet, or as short as almost four and a half feet. Regardless of height though, elves tend to put a heavy weight on the notion of creativity, due to the notion that magic is only limited by the mind. If one can truly envision it, then one can make it happen. So with centuries long lives, potentially upwards of almost a millenia, many use their time to show openness and compassion to others. As despite the common place belief of elves being an overly prideful and potentially "snooty" people, it would be hard to get further from the truth.
						</br>
						</br>
						While there of course will be some, especially among notably awful individuals of history, elves tend to take on a much more parental view towards other races. Some elves may reach up to living upwards of seven hundred or more years, if they devote themselves in whole to their magic, most only live to maybe five hundred at most. Thus in that time, still far outliving most, many elves take a wider view by seeing the progress most races make in a small fraction of their own lifetimes. So many take on a viewpoint of seeing themselves as responsible for steering the paths others take in life. This in itself is a large part of why despite elves being seen as almost uncommon or rare, their culture and people can be found almost anywhere.

				<h2>
					Gnomes
				</h2>
				<p>
					<b>
						Standing a slight bit shorter than their bulky cousins, gnomes are often seen as the brains to dwarven brawn. Often seen as being natural born tinkerers, this small and curious race descends from fae, and as such are often looked upon with a cautious gaze. However, long ago their kind split between those that ended living underground with the dwarves and those that joined the elves in their forests. It is by their hands and wit that many magical artifacts were crafted for empires of old, and pushed the bounds for forging paths into the future.
						</br>
						</br>
						Normally they are a slight bit over three feet tall, if not slightly shorter, with distinctly pointed ears and sometimes rather bushy eyebrows. Though due to their fae ancestry, they are also commonly known for their rather vibrant hair colours that seem to range the entire rainbow. Most gnomes descending from those that lived with the dwarves tend to have pale and sometimes grey skin with lighter coloured hair. Meanwhile those from the forests usually have slightly tanned skin and brown to blond hair and far more vibrant eye colours than their formerly mountain dwelling counterparts.
						</br>
						</br>
						Due to their fae ancestry, their hair colour is not the only thing they inherit. As additionally they are known to commonly have a more "trickster" nature to them when they are young. While this nature may never fade, where it is directed often changes, shifting from being aimed at other mortals to instead beings of great power, or even the world itself. Thus tends to be seen as a part of a gnome's nature to 'one-up' any challenge placed before, even if simply to turn the challenge back upon its origin. Though, while labelled as tricksters, this is often done with a genuine desire to see what new innovation may come and eagerness to push those around them to greater heights.

				<h2>
					Goblins
				</h2>
				<p>
					<b>
						Despite being depicted as small, ugly, and destructive green pests by many, goblins are actually among the most widely varied among the races. The negative views most have of them are due to their feral counterparts. For there is a belief held that goblins had at one point actually been of the same fae that eventually became gnomes, but were twisted, corrupted, and cursed. It is because of this that during the events following the schism, most goblins flocked to seek shelter under the giants. Yet this also may well have aided to the hatred from and towards them. As even under the guidance of the giants, much of goblin culture for a long time hinged around aggression and anger for all the wrongs done to their people.
						</br>
						</br>
						In spite of the depictions of goblins having almost demonic-like facial features, thin mouths with rows of jagged teeth, pig-like noses, deep set glowing red eyes, and looking like their skin has been stretched over their skulls, most look less evil. The appearance of a majority of goblin-kind is almost more likened to cats with their pointy ears and button noses. Standing at around three feet, they tend to have large pointed ears that move in conjunction to their current mood, skin colours almost as wide ranging as their gnomish cousins' hair colours, and some may even have tails. While one clan may appear one way, another clan might look about as similar as trying to compare orcs and humans. However, opposite of gnomes, that can in theory live forever, goblin life is short and generally seen as disposable.
						</br>
						</br>
						Even before the schism, most goblins live their lives in a dead sprint, reaching full adulthood in only a handful of years, and dying not long after. This in part is due to the supposed curse upon their people, but also is heavily tied to them being pushed by most civilized races to live as either feral animals in the woods, or as slaves. So while they might have a voracious appetite for knowledge, in their world often raw strength and survival by "whatever works" comes out on top. However, that it not to say their kind is without hope. As while there are many that still live wild lives, giving in to the curse on their lineage, there do exist many goblins in the modern day that have found a better life. Thus it is not unheard of for goblins of the Gnok people, or their descendants that have spread across the world, to live as long as many humans might.

				<h2>
					Halflings
				</h2>
				<p>
					<b>
						Sometimes mistaken for human children, Halflings are also known to have the pure heart and whimsy of their look-alikes. As least, that is the way many that have never met a halfling are told to view them. While in some regards true, as much of the culture their kind hold is driven towards kindness and viewing a desire to seek family wherever they can, they have been known to have darker sides. As almost equal to their willingness to share what they have with others, they might well be likely to share what others have with themselves without asking. For some it may be an honest mistake, for others a simple cover to try and get away with having wandering fingers.
						</br>
						</br>
						With being almost three feet in height at their tallest and looking very akin to humans, halflings tend to live in and around where their taller counterparts settle. In colour and in shape, the halfling people are almost akin to goblins in how varied they may be. In fact, as a halfling grows and physically develops, they may well find their body changing to match the types of people they live near and with. Thus it is hard to give a proper physical description of them, as even the more common belief that they tend to walk barefoot with thick tufts of hair on top of their feet is not universal with simply being an easy visual distinction.
						</br>
						</br>
						One might come to believe that the position of nobility might well fall to the wayside for a people known to blend in with the "common man." However, quite the opposite is in fact the case. By the virtues held among much of their people, reaching a position of power in order to help those below them is a common sentiment among many halflings. It is even a reason for many as to why they may choose to seek the titles and fame that adventuring might carry with it. So while halfling nobles may not be the most common thing to see in history books, don't doubt the chances of any given halfling being of noble blood, and simply preferring the company of common folk. In general actually, most other races often do have some level of trouble feeling like they ever properly have an understanding of any halfling they may travel with.

				<h2>
					Humans
				</h2>
				<p>
					<b>
						Potentially somewhat surprising to any not from Fluia or versed in its history, humans are believed to be the descendants of dragons. To most this comes more in the metaphorical form, with humans having been the main people of Rake culture and who populated the dragon empire before it collapsed. However, to others, especially those that have met dragons choosing to take a humanoid form, there may be reason to believe there is a more literal side to this alleged ancestry. As while they have an appearance almost more akin to that of a shrunken giant, this supposedly comes from a conflict that existed between the two celestial tribes, with dragons taking amusement in mocking giants.
						</br>
						</br>
						With a height averaging between five and a half feet to just over six feet tall, humans arguably look like the melting pot of every other race. Truthfully there isn't much to say that is not already known. Their hair colours generally range between blonde, brown, and red, but may take on other colours if possibly having some gnomish ancestry. Typically human skin colours vary from a pale tan colour to beed brown and almost full black. Though despite their seemingly overwhelming "average" nature that lends to many being sceptical of them descending from dragons, there are a number of other pointers. Lacking a natural talent for a specific magic or for physical strength, humans tend to hold a drive and capability to match if not exceed other races in the skills they may spend hundreds of years honing.
						</br>
						</br>
						Much like their supposed draconic progenitors, many humans hold a deep seeded sense of nobility and willingness to claw their way on top. With a starting point seen as well below any other, except maybe goblins and kobolds, humans are seen as having a near infinite potential. This in turn is what lends an air of authenticity. Be it through endless toil and research of magic, comprehension of the world around them, or willingness to go where many others would not dare, they have found ways other races might have viewed impossible to reach new heights. It is for this reason why long after the fall of the dragon empire that spanned almost all of Fluia, humans still are seen as

						<h2>
							Leshy
						</h2>
						<p>
					<b>
						Spirit folk or plant-kin, Leshies are a much newer race of people to enter the fold and spread across the lands of Fluia. Believed to have originated from Trow meddling in the far south, their kind might feel as if they pop up where you might least expect it. For while one might normally expect to come across their kind in woodlands or jungles that feel full of life, these places tend to be easy places for Leshy to go unnoticed. Instead you are far more likely to actually take notice of their existence in cities or ruins that are slowly being reclaimed by nature. Thus overall, they tend to be a curious people, wanting to explore and simply witness all there is to the physical world, as opposed to deeply understanding it.
						</br>
						</br>
						To try and describe what leshy look like would be akin to trying to describe what flowers look like. Not any specific flower, just flowers in general. As while gnomes, goblins, and halflings might be varied in appearance, you would be hard pressed to find two Leshy that look alike. Being born from magical summoning, and existing as long as they have natural magics to sustain them, these spirits tend to resemble the place they were born from and may change slightly to reflect any environment they might live in long enough. However, this latter change is rarely seen outside of exceptionally large shifts in location, like taking a Leshy born deep in the woods out into frozen mountains devoid of plant life.
						</br>
						</br>
						While spirits can never truly die, without a physical form, most spirits have no true sense of memory. Thus while when a Leshy might lose its physical body, it can be resummoned into a new one, it may as well be a new person with simply the same personality as who it was before. In turn there is often an odd matter of how many that travel with these plant-like people treat their lives as almost more important than those who may only live one life. Meanwhile for many Leshy, while death is not ideal, it is generally simply seen as a fresh chance to eventually experience the world anew once again when next they might be given a physical body.

				<h2>
					Orcs
				</h2>
				<p>
					<b>
						The bastard children of dwarves and elves, inheriting the strength and brutal values of one and the height and pride of the other. This is the general sentiment that many have of orcish-kind, believing their people to be the descendants of the two earthly tribes, and inheriting "the worst qualities of both." How true this may be is entirely up for debate, but it is known that much of orcish culture since the Schism did in fact come from Dunirr culture. Yet in spite of the belief that these people are nothing but wild beasts of brute force, there have actually been many orcish scholars and even nobles.
						</br>
						</br>
						Orcs tend to strike a rather intimidating figure with being burly individuals and on average six and half to almost seven feet tall. Some orcs though have been known to be as short as a little over five feet tall, or as large as nearly seven and half feet. Their skin can vary from being grey, green, or potentially even similar shades of tan as humans. While often depicted having pig-like noses, similar to goblins, this tends to be inaccurate, though many do have wider noses due to most orcs originating from either dry lands near mountains or up in the mountains. Overall, orcs actually tend to have very human features, if maybe a little more angular with elf-like pointed ears. The most notable distinction aside from their skin is the extra pair of lower teeth that they have grown large enough to show out of their mouth, which is larger on male orcs than on female orcs.
						</br>
						</br>
						While many of their kin may feel the pressure from other races to push them back into the wild tribal life orcs descend from, many have happily split from that life. In fact, when such bigotry rises in civil environments, many orcs are happy to remind those showing such discourtesy that just about all other races equally descended from the wilds. On the other end, if approached with kindness, most orcs are also known to value those they hold close above almost all else.
