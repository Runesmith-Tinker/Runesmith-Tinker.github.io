			<h1 header style="font-family: 'Almendra'"> History of Fluia </h1>
			<h2 The Schism> The Schism </h2>
			<p body>
				<b>
					Long ago Fluia used to be part of a much larger world that thrived with primal life and magic flowed effortlessly. The gods supposedly walked among men, watching them and caring for them like parents watching their children grow. Yet something happened to disturb this golden age, as the gods of old were brought low and a darkness spread across the world. One by one the old gods were felled and with each pillar of the world left unsupported the delicate balance of reality began to fray at the edges. Eventually things had gone too far, and the world was rent asunder with much of it being returned to the primordial soup of an unformed universe. However, a fragment of that world was instead cast astray into the Astral sea, eventually finding a new home plane all of its own.
					</br>
					</br>
					This is at least the generally believed and upheld notion of what happened around one and a half thousand years ago to lead to the current state of the world. As some researchers have studied the shattered remnant of the world, and it's curved state does suggest that it once was part of a larger round planet. In fact some giants and dragons of old have even attested to recalling vaguely what the world before was like. However, just about any information outside of simple eyewitness claims from ancient beings about the lost world seemed to have been lost with the schism.
					</br>
					</br>
					Though, another name suggesting something far worse than just the prime material plane being affected does exist. As among Realmwalkers that live the daring and risky life of travelling across the planes, The Schism has instead been called The Sundering. Similar to what happened to the prime material plane being ripped apart and only a fragment being left, so too were many other planes also shattered.

			<h2 The Dark Era> The Dark Era </h2>
			<p body>
				<b>
					Following The Schism, there are somewhere between three hundred and four hundred years of unrecorded history. The only form of documentation as to what happened are myths and legends passed down by word of mouth. However, it is said that it was during this time that each of the four tribes that managed to remain intact during essentially the end of the world took in many other races. Even the foulest of dragons, the most uncaring of giants, the most suspicious of dwarves, and the most prideful of elves relented at the beginning of this time of sheer pandemonium. As when all things are about to end, and none will be spared, it takes very little for each to set aside their differences in a simple hope of feeling some comfort before annihilation.
					</br>
					</br>
					This time of peace did not last long though. Historians believe from what has been described that it lasted maybe ten to twenty years as many were twisted and warped by the wild magics of the lands. Eventually though, as the world seemed to settle back into some form of order, there were wars for power. It was in this time with such vast amounts of magic that new gods took rise. Each of the tribes had champions that led their charge to lay claim to what was left of the world, in one way or another. Yet in the end it was the group of six individuals known as the current gods in all their forms that came out above all others, regardless of which tribe they might have belonged to before.
					</br>
					</br>
					Sadly, as stated, this all comes as simply an attempt to piece together a wholly unknown narrative based on vague legends of the different tribes and the existence of the current six gods.

			<h2 The Dragon Era> The Dragon Era </h2>
			<p body>
				<b>
					After whatever events had transpired during The Dark Era, it is at least known what the outcome was. Of the four tribes, the two <a href="./Nations/Cultures/Cultures.html" style="color:black;">Celestial Tribes</a> were known to be much stronger than the two <a href="./Nations/Cultures/Cultures.html" style="color:black;">Earthly Tribes</a>. Yet the peoples that made up the Celestial Tribes, the dragons of the Rake and the giants of the Solkug, were significantly fewer in number than the peoples of the Earthly Tribes, the dwarves of the Dunirr and the elves of the Trow. The importance of this matters in the question of why it was that out of the end of the Dark Era that an empire led by the Rake tribe seemed to swiftly wash across the lands with little opposition. In turn, the most common belief is that with the strongest of the six gods being of dragon blood, that the Rake and their draconic lords felt invigorated by the notion that it would be their people that were meant to bring order to the world.
					</br>
					</br>
					To the far north, the giants seemed to care very little about conflict with the dragons, and so simply receded further into the frozen wastes that the Rake had no interest in. Thus no opposition came to their laying claim to the entirety of the western continent fell under draconic rule in a matter of years. This formed the foundation of the dragon empire, built upon the backs of scholars and enslaved "monster" races. The scholars lead the way in the field of creating a new type of magic that was stable and could be used consistently for more than simply combat. The slaves paved the road as the main work force used for the building of their massive cities and were placed at the front lines of their armies as fodder with no choice but to fight or die.
					</br>
					</br>
					For a little over a century the dragon empire reigned over the western continent of Fluia, even resulting in its modern name of Drackus and thus the term Drackiot for those from the west. The east in turn came to be known as Elwahr, quite literally derived from the shortening of "elsewhere", and the term Elwharan for those from the Eastern lands. Over the span of the empire's rise in the west, and the time it spent sitting idle and developing, the east was far from quiet. War raged between the Trow and Dunirr people. The elves of the Trow favoured fostering the divine and occult so that it might lead to a higher enlightenment, but to do so required spreading and learning more about what was left of the world. The dwarves of the Dunirr on the other hand saw a world that needed to be seized and bound in place before it fell back into the chaos that had almost destroyed everything. This conflict was known as The Endless War of the Night, as many believe the animosity born by this conflict between the long lived descendants of the Trow and Dunirr lives on even to modern times between many of those from their descendant cultures.
					</br>
					</br>
					This conflict would in turn eventually become the cause for the downfall of both tribes. As the dragon to the west had little desire to simply sit idly by while there was more of the world not claimed as part of their treasure. Moreover, they had one thing that neither the Dunirr nor Trow had, and that was the ability to cross the ocean between the two lands. It was early in the 133rd year of The Dragon Era, referred to at the time as the Dawn Era, that dragon riders were reportedly first sighted having crossed the Metab ocean that spanned between the Drackus continent and the Elwahr continent. They levelled villages of Trow and Dunirr alike without discrimination, claiming slaves from any that they did not simply wipe out. Each at first pointed fingers at the other. The elves believed the rounded eared individuals to simply be a taller breed of dwarf, riding atop a new war beast tamed in their damned mountains. The dwarves in turn believed these tall people to simply be a bread of elf with round ears that road atop some new monstrosity birthed from their cursed magics.
					</br>
					</br>
					It did not take long for the two people to realize that the new threat from beyon the coast belonged to neither of their tribes. The first summit was had in their decades long war, in aim to address the matter of a foreign force seeming to be interfering with their own conflict. For the briefest moment, this almost seemed to open the chance that the invasion of the Rake people and the Dragon Empire might in fact bring an end to The Endless War of the Night. Yet in accounts recorded from the summit, the elven embassadors had proposed that the Dunirr people come under the wing of the Trow, as such together combine their strength against the the outside force. This in turn was promptly laughed at, with the dwarven embassadors remarking on how the new force only had an interest in the surface, and so all they needed do was return to their homes below and wait for the elves to be burned away. So ended the first, and seemingly last, chance that the Trow and Dunirr had to actually fight against the invading armies. As only weeks after the conference, the Rake warships landed on their shores, offloading several tens of thousands of war slaves and thousands to low tens of thousands of soldiers.
					</br>
					</br>
					While battles between the Dunirr and the Trow lessened, their conflict with the Rake peoples grew. Over the nearly four hundred years that The War of Wyvern raged, a total of seven hundred and twelve more conferences happened. Nearly two hundred years in though, there was divide among the people of the Trow, with many wishing to continue following the old ways, but many seeing they were losing the war. Thus rose the Eldar peoples, who chose to abandon the ancient magics of Orophet in favour of using the structured magics of Agnosti known by the Rake. As while the old magic was incredibly powerful, it also was highly volatile and almost uncontrolable, while the newer magic could be studied and built upon despite its less powerful base. Not long after, the orkish Ulguk tribe broke from the Dunirr dwarves, seeing their choice to hide from the dragons as cowardice and spitting in the face of Kylnvar. They wanted to either taste the blood of their enemies, or die happily in "glorious" combat with a worthy enemy.
					</br>
					</br>
					Six hundred years after the end of the dark era, the last summit of the War of the Wyvern was held. Not between the Trow and Dunirr, but instead between the Rake, The Eldar, and the Dunirr. The elves had done what they could to oppose the dragons, their riders, and their armies, but their will to fight had been broken from endlessly watching their cities be levelled and their people slaughtered. Thus even entering the summit that the dwarves believed would once more be a futile discussion between their kind and the elves, the Eldar abassadors entereed with hung heads. Behind them followed their new mastered and lords, the human embassadors of the Rake. The elven embassadors were forced to sit for an entire day watching as the emissaries of the Rake tortured each of the dwarves, leaving only a single one alive at the end to return to his people and advice his lords to submit to the Rake or worse would come. In turn, the elves were told that it was wise of them to submit willingly, and thus why they would be spared such treatment.
					</br>
					</br>
					Shortly after, just about everything that the dragon empire had built up began to come crumbling back down. As with the end of the war, there was peace and even prosperity for a while. Many of the dragons were cruel lords that wished nothing more than to hoard wealth and power. Others though had an actual interest in overseeing the well being of their people. Yet after a decade and a half, and a year after the last remnants of rebelion fell away, so to vanished the interest in ruling that the majority of the daconic lords saw fit to. Any sence of allegiance they felt with one another turned to dust. Those that had spent centuries carving a path fowards, driven simply by their own greed and a desire to show that they could rule over everything felt they had achieved just that. And so most of the lords of the great dragon empires in essence simply decide they were satisfied and wished to return home rather than actually ruling. To this day even, many dragons raid villages and demand tithes from near by towns and cities out of a view that those living there are still citizens of the long gone empire that they ruled over.

					What took over six centuries to built up, took less than five years to completely fall apart. A little over three quarters of the draconic lords simply vanished from their seats of power, leaving the other quarter to struggle to try and hold everything they had created together. Yet in the vacuum of power there were endless foes seeking to fill it. Some wished for a return to the old ways, with it having onto been a couple decades, hardly a blink of an eye for peoples that could live several centuries. For many others though, the old ways had been stripped bare and torn down by the war and the dragon empire, and thus wished to push on and make something new. Across the face of Fluia this conflict gripped just about everywhere and everyone in it's clutches.
					</br>
					</br>
					On Elwhar the descent was quick. The Eldar moved to try and reclaim their lands while the dwarves found themselves divided. Those following the old codes of the Dunirr wished to return to their homes blow ground and hold claim over their their cultural homeland. However, a large faction of dwarves, now more thoroughly exposed to the ways of other peoples and especially the Eldar after they had been humbled by the dragons, wished to continue engaging with the rest of the world. These individuals eventually came to be known as the Zundizar people, and in turn a large number of orks desiring a far less violent life chose to follow after them and form the Ulkon people.
