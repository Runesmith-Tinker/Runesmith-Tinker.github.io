			<h1 header> The Great Dragon Hunt </h1>
			<h2 welcome> Welcome to the world of Fluia. </h2>
			<p body>
				A bright a resplendent landscape upon an admittedly small world, left stripped from the realm it once was part of ages ago. Ever since the Schism nearly a thousand years ago, the world has Been left pulling itself back together by tooth and claw. Tales of grand empires pass by word of mouth from parent to child, with only the ruins of old to make them more than simple myths. From those ruins and rubble though, a few nations have found their way into lasting stability out of the chaos that lasted for centuries after the end of the old world.
				</br></br>
				While for the moment a temperamental peace exists between nations on each of the countries, it comes more from a mutual lingering threat brought with the schism. Massive hulking beasts of old that once ruled one of the continents, now left simply to act as tormentors of those alive today. Legendary Dragons. Creatures that used to be revered as if they were gods, with an empire that stretched the Western continent. Even with the fall of their empire though, a lingering handful still haunt the world. Some are more kindly than others, but all are looked upon with a fearful gaze by the rulers of each nation.
