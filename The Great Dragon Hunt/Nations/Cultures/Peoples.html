			<h1 header style="font-family: 'Almendra'"> The Peoples of Fluia </h1>
			<p style="font-size:1.25em;">
				The Great Dragon Hunt was written as a setting for a Pathfinder 2e campain. As such, all races below are at least somewhat connected to their PF2e counter part, and will have a link to their Archives of Nethys counterpart. The full list can be found <a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Ancestries.aspx">here</a>. Rare races are not listed below on the matter that they would be rare enough that there would not truly exist any "common place" knowledge of any of their kind.
				</br>
				Potentially of more importance, what is below are simply the <u><i>most common</i></u> beliefs and views about each race of people across Fluia. None of them are truely without exception, especially after hundreds of years for races and cultures to intermingle and interact.
			</p>
			<h2 welcome> The Common Races </h2>
			<p>
				<b>
					The peoples known to be among the "common races" are those you may expect to see every day, filling out the crowds you see at the markets or fellow patrons at taverns and inns. Having spread far and wide all across Fluia, most nations are controlled and lead by people of one or mutliple of these races. They are also seen as being the primary descendants of the four ancient tribes that sruvived the Schism.

			<h2 welcome> The Uncommon Races </h2>
			<p body>
				<b>
					Those that fall among the "uncommon" or "exotic" races are also often known as belonging to the "remnant" races. As when the Schism happened, there were many who survived that did not belong to the four main tribes, but still lived in areas protected by them or were sheltered by them. Thus they now live on as remnants of the vastly more diverse world that Fluia once was before the schism. So while the statement of the below being only the most common view points, these peoples are often either far more diverse, or tend to choose to simply integrate with those of a common race that they live close to.
